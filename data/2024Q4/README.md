[Understanding Free Cultural Works - Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/freeworks/):

> Using [the Freedom Defined definition of a "Free Cultural Work"], material licensed under CC BY or BY-SA is a free cultural work. (So is anything in the worldwide public domain marked with CC0 or the Public Domain Mark.) CC’s other licenses– BY-NC, BY-ND, BY-NC-SA, and BY-NC-ND–only allow more limited uses, and material under these licenses is not considered a free cultural work.
