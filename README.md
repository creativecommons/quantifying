Quantifying the Commons


## Overview

This project seeks to quantify the size and diversity of the commons--the
collection of works that are openly licensed or in the public domain.


### 2024 Status

This project is currently being worked on as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
project. The goal is to add automation of data gathering and report generation
so that our reports quantifying the commons are never more than 3 months out of
date. To prepare for this refactor, previous work was moved to
[`pre-automation/`](pre-automation/).

## Development


### Prerequisites

This repository uses [pipenv][pipenvdocs] to manage the required Python
modules:
1. Install `pipenv`:
   - Linux: [Installing Pipenv][pipenvinstall]
   - macOS:
     1. Install [Homebrew][homebrew]
     2. Install pipenv:
        ```shell
        brew install pipenv
        ```
   - Windows: [Installing Pipenv][pipenvinstall]
2. Create the Python virtual environment and install prerequisites using
   `pipenv`:
    ```shell
    pipenv sync --dev
    ```

### Running scripts that require client credentials

To successfully run scripts that require client credentials, you will need to
follow these steps:
1. Copy the contents of the `env.example` file in the script's directory to
   `.env`:
    ```shell
    cp env.example .env
    ```
2. Uncomment the variables in the `.env` file and assign values as needed. See
   [`sources.md`](sources.md) on how to get credentials:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEYS=your_api_key
    PSE_KEY=your_pse_key
    ```
3. Save the changes to the `.env` file.
4. You should now be able to run scripts that require client credentials
   without any issues.


### Static analysis

Static analysis tools ensure the codebase adheres to consistent formatting and
style guidelines, enhancing readability and maintainability. Also see GitHub
Actions, below.


#### Using [`pre-commit`][pre-commit]

Pre-commit allows for static analysis tools (`black`, `flake8`, `isort`, etc.)
to be run manually or with every commit:

1. (Pre-commit is installed by completing Create the Python virtual environment
   and install prerequisites, above)
2. Install or run manually
   - Install the git hook scripts to enable automatic execution on every commit
       ```shell
       pipenv run pre-commit install
       ```
   - Run manually before commit:
       ```shell
       pipenv run pre-commit run -a
       ```
3. _(Optional)_ review the configuration file:
   [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml)


#### Using [`dev/tools.sh`][tools-sh] helper script

The [`dev/tools.sh`][tools-sh] helper script runs the static analysis tools
(`black`, `flake8`, and `isort`):
```shell
./dev/tools.sh
```

It can also accept command-line arguments to specify specific files or
directories to check:
```shell
./dev/tools.sh PATH/TO/MY/FILE.PY
```

### GitHub Actions

The [`.github/workflows/python_static_analysis.yml`][workflow-static-analysis]
GitHub Actions workflow performs static analysis (`black`, `flake8`, and
`isort`) on committed changes. The workflow is triggered automatically when you
push changes to the main branch or open a pull request.
