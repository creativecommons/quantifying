Quantifying the Commons


## Overview

This project seeks to quantify the size and diversity of the commons--the
collection of works that are openly licensed or in the public domain.


### Meaningful

The reports generated by this project (and the data fetched and processed to
support it) seeks to be meaningful. We hope this project will provide data and
analysis that helps inform discussions about the commons--the collection of
works that are openly licensed or in the public domain.

The goal of this project is to help answer questions like:
- How has the world's use of the commons changed over time?
- How is the knowledge and culture of the commons distributed?
  - Who has access (and how much) to the commons?
- What significant trends can be observed in the commons?
  - Which public domain dedication or licenses are the most popular?
  - What are the correlations between public domain dedication or licenses and
    region, language, domain/endeavor, etc.?

## Development


### Prerequisites

For information on learning and installing the prerequisite technologies for
this project, please see [Foundational technologies — Creative Commons Open
Source][found-tech].

This repository uses [pipenv][pipenvdocs] to manage the required Python
modules:
1. Install `pipenv`:
   - Linux: [Installing Pipenv][pipenvinstall]
   - macOS:
     1. Install [Homebrew][homebrew]
     2. Install pipenv:
        ```shell
        brew install pipenv
        ```
   - Windows: [Installing Pipenv][pipenvinstall]
2. Create the Python virtual environment and install prerequisites using
   `pipenv`:
    ```shell
    pipenv sync --dev
    ```

[found-tech]: https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/foundational-tech/
[pipenvdocs]: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
[pipenvinstall]: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/
[homebrew]: https://brew.sh/


### Managing client credentials

Client credentials should be stored in an environment file:
1. Copy the contents of the `env.example` file in the script's directory to
   `.env`:
    ```shell
    cp env.example .env
    ```
2. Uncomment the variables in the `.env` file and assign values as needed. See
   [`sources.md`](sources.md) on how to get credentials:
    ```
    GCS_DEVELOPER_KEY = your_api_key
    GCS_CX = your_pse_id
    ```
3. Save the changes to the `.env` file.

You should now be able to run scripts that require client credentials without
any issues. The `.env` file is ignored by git to help ensure sensitive data is
not distributed.


### Running the scripts

All of the scripts should be run from the root of the repository using pipenv. For example:
```bash
pipenv run ./scripts/1-fetch/github_fetch.py -h
```

When run this way, the shared library (`scripts/shared.py`) provides easy access
to all of the necessary paths and all of the modules managed by pipenv are
available.


### Static analysis

Static analysis tools ensure the codebase adheres to consistent formatting and
style guidelines, enhancing readability and maintainability. Also see GitHub
Actions, below.


#### Using [`pre-commit`][pre-commit]

Pre-commit allows for static analysis tools (`black`, `flake8`, `isort`, etc.)
to be run manually or with every commit:

1. (Pre-commit is installed by completing Create the Python virtual environment
   and install prerequisites, above)
2. Install or run manually
   - Install the git hook scripts to enable automatic execution on every commit
       ```shell
       pipenv run pre-commit install
       ```
   - Run manually using helper dev script:
       ```shell
       ./dev/check.sh [FILE]
       ```
     If no file(s) are specified, then it runs against all files:
       ```shell
       ./dev/check.sh
       ```
3. _(Optional)_ review the configuration file:
   [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml)

### GitHub Actions

The [`.github/workflows/python_static_analysis.yml`][workflow-static-analysis]
GitHub Actions workflow performs static analysis (`black`, `flake8`, and
`isort`) on committed changes. The workflow is triggered automatically when you
push changes to the main branch or open a pull request.
