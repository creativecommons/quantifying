### Tooling

- **[Python Guidelines — Creative Commons Open Source][ccospyguide]**
- [Black][black]: the uncompromising Python code formatter
- [flake8][flake8]: a python tool that glues together pep8, pyflakes, mccabe,
  and third-party plugins to check the style and quality of some python code.
- [isort][isort]: A Python utility / library to sort imports.

## Data Sources
### Flickr
- The Flickr API exposes identifiers for users, photos, photosets and other uniquely identifiable objects.
- The Flickr API consists of a set of callable methods, and some API endpoints.
- For more detailed description: visit Flickr API documentation(https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
- The file hs.csv is a sample csv of pulled data. Ideally the script will generate final data CSVs.
- Each license will have a csv to save the data.
- Due to memory limit, the license CSVs are not pushed into github.

#### CC Legal Tools

- [`legal-tool-paths.txt`](google_custom_search/legal-tool-paths.txt)
  - A `.txt` provided by Timid Robot containing all legal tool paths. The data
    from Google Custom Search will only cover 50+ general, most significant
    categories of CC License for data collection quota constraint. As an
    additional note, the order of precedence of license the collected data's
    first column is sorted due to intermediate data analysis progress.

#### Google Custom Search JSON API

- The Custom Search JSON API allows user-defined detailed query and access
  towards related query data using a programmable search engine.
  - [Custom Search JSON API Reference | Programmable Search Engine | Google
    Developers][googlejsonapi]
  - [Method: cse.list | Custom Search JSON API | Google Developers][cselist]
- [`google_countries.tsv`](google_custom_search/google_countries.txt)
  - Created by directly copy and pasting the `cr` parameter list from the
    following link into a `.tsv` file as there were no reliable algorithmic way
    for retrieving such data found in the process so far. The script itself
    will take care of the formatting and country-selection process.
    - [Country Collection Values | JSON API reference | Programmable Search
      Engine | Google Developers][googlecountry]
- [`google_lang.txt`](google_custom_search/google_lang.txt)
  - Created by directly copy and pasting the `lr` parameter list from the
    following link into a `.txt` file as there were no reliable algorithmic way
    for retrieving such data found in the process so far. The script itself
    will take care of the data formatting and language-selection process.
    - [Parameter: lr | Method: cse.list | Custom Search JSON API | Google
      Developers][googlelang]

#### Internet Archive Python Interface

A python interface to archive.org to achieve API requests towards internet
archive.

  archive.org][iasearch]

#### The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API

An API endpoint for receiving Metropolitan Muesum of Art Collection's
CC-Licensed works.

[Latest Updates | The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API][metapi]:
> The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on
> more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and
> noncommercial use. To the extent possible under law, The Metropolitan Museum
> of Art has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this
> dataset using the [Creative Commons Zero][cc-zero] license.

#### Vimeo API

The Vimeo API allows users to perform filtered, advanced search on Vimeo
videos.
- [Getting Started with the Vimeo API][vimeostart]
  - [Search for videos - Vimeo API Reference: Videos][vimeoapisearch]

[vimeostart]: https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start
[vimeoapisearch]: https://developer.vimeo.com/api/reference/videos#search_videos


#### MediaWiki API

- The MediaWiki Action API is a web service that allows access to some wiki
  features like authentication, page operations, and search. It can provide
  meta information about the wiki and the logged-in user.
  - Example query: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&cmtitle=Category:CC-BY&list=categorymembers
- [`language-codes_csv.csv`](wikipedia/language-codes_csv.csv)
  - A list of language codes in ISO 639-1 Format to access statistics of each
    wikipedia main page across different languages. In the script, this file is
    named as `language-codes_csv` to minimize the amount of manual work
    required for running the script provided the same language encoding file.
    The user would have to rename the header and file name of their `.csv` ISO
    code list according to the concurrent file on Github if they would like to
    use some list other than the concurrent one.
  - This file that this script uses can be downloaded from:
    https://datahub.io/core/language-codes


#### Youtube Data API

An API from YouTube for platform users to upload videos, adjust video
parameters, and obtain search results.
- [Search: list | YouTube Data API | Google Developers][youtubeapi]
