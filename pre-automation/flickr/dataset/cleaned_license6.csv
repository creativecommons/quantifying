Designed by architects Russell and Cooper it was completed in 1911 just after the Federation of the City Stoke-on-Trent the previous year, which rendered its original purpose obsolete. Under Plan B the Hall was opened as the Queen's Theatre, a venue for drama, concerts and other entertainments. By 1998 requiring extensive repairs, the Grade II listed theatre closed as a permanent venue although events continued to take place sporadically until 2014 when the shutters went up for good (or bad!). Like so many other wonderful Grade II listed buildings in the City, this grand old lady is gently slipping into dereliction.

A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
-- Paul McCartney

2022 has been tough. But recently my friend Kim Carucci was appointed to lead my department. She's a great leader and a great choice. It's a tough job but I have faith. And of course I'm glad to be back in the saddle and slowly healing. Also happy to have opted to ride Enfields exclusively (due to the unavailability of parts for Japanese motorcycles). Little things make a difference. For example now both of my bikes use the same motor oil. As Tolstoy said, &quot;Simplify! Simplify!&quot;

952,"Los Angeles, CA, USA",2022-09-11 03:25:08,6.0,"SOUTH PARK - The Los Angeles City Fire Department battled a Major Emergency Structure Fire early Sunday morning, on Patriot Day, at the Victory Baptist Church. Intense fire weakened the structural supports and collapsed, trapping several firefighters and sending three to the hospital.

Approximately 150 firefighters were ultimately called to the 4800 block of South McKinley Avenue in the early morning hours of Sunday, September 11, 2022, where 9-1-1 callers had reported smoke coming from Victory Baptist Church. Crews initially made entry to find heavy smoke inside the structure. As firefighters made entry, inevitably introducing more air to the conditions inside, fire behavior worsened quickly.

Approximately 30 minutes after the arrival of firefighters, there was a structural collapse inside, trapping several LAFD members. Two consecutive mayday calls were put out on the radio alerting the fire ground of trapped firefighters. Nearby crews quickly effected a rescue of three firefighters. One was transported immediately to a local hospital in moderate condition, while a second finished battling the fire and was transported in fair condition after the flames were declared to be knocked down. The third followed up with care on his own after the incident.

After the interior collapse, crews withdrew into defensive operations, utilizing heavy streams from the exterior of the building. It took one hour and forty minutes to extinguish the flames. LAFD Heavy Equipment was called out to assist with moving debris to access hot spots. Crews will remain working throughout the day to continue uncovering smoldering debris in the rubble.

LAFD's House of Worship Task Force and Arson/Counter-Terrorism Section are working together to conduct the fire-cause investigation, which remains active.

1055,"Los Angeles, CA, USA",2022-09-05 15:00:30,6.0,"BOYLE HEIGHTS - It took the relentless effort of over 180 firefighters, during a triple-digit heatwave on Monday, two hours to extinguish a stubborn fire, which consumed conjoined structures in Boyle Heights.

The Los Angeles Fire Department was summoned at 2:12 PM on September 5, 2022 (Labor Day) to the 2800 block of East 11th Street, where firefighters arrived quickly to find an already well-developed fire inside of a large one-story row of commercial buildings, amid a week-long Los Angeles heatwave.

Defensive firefighting operations under the command of Assistant Chief Dean Zipperman continued for two hours until the fire was declared extinguished at 4:12 PM. While fighting the fire, four firefighters sustained non-life-threatening injuries (one struck by falling debris, three encountered an electrical hazard) and were transported to a local hospital. All four were released later in the day and remained on duty for their shift.

The expansive structure, which contained many separate businesses side-by-side, sustained significant damage in five consecutive occupancies.

1589,USA,2022-09-16 10:27:15,6.0,"Benni is having a wonderful day of celebration and family visiting.  Kerri and Alex are here for 2 weeks and we all went to Laguna this morning.  Then to In-N-Out for hamburgers where Benni got her own beef patty.  When Kerri ordered it and told the cashier it was for our dog's 12th birthday, the kind woman said it was free and would come with no salt.
This afternoon everyone is resting but then Benni will get her favorite doggy frozen yogurt, bacon and banana flavor.  She can have almost no exercise due to very labored breathing when she gets excited, hot, people come to the door.  Otherwise, she is my sweet Benni, being sure Rena the cat doesn't get too much attention.

A note of apology.  This has been a very challenging month but Don is slowing recovering from what looked like a stroke but was a swollen and inflamed brain for a trial drug he was on.  His motor skills are fine but his memory is just not there.  His right eye doesn't track with his left so he can't read for enjoyment.  There are many scans and doctor appts. all the time and life is complicated.  They do predict a complete recovery over &quot;weeks&quot; which appear to be months.

I do see everyone's posts each day and like to know things are normal with most everyone.  I pray for those who have lost loved ones, furry and otherwise, or sick,  and hope things are great for all of us soon.","['Benni', 'Labradoodle', 'Benni Girl', 'dogs', 'dog', 'dog birthday', 'Explore']",7150.0,45.0

Jimmy Governor had a red headed Irish father and an Aboriginal mother. He was employed on the Mawbey family farm between Gilgandra and Mendooran as a fencer for five shillings a day wages. Jimmy and his white wife and child lived in a hut on the property. His wife worked casually in the Mawbey homestead and often complained of the treatment meted out to her by husband Jimmy. The Mawbey women sympathised and told her to “leave the brute”. Ethel Governor told her husband the advice given to her. Jimmy employed his brother Joe and Jacky Underwood to help him complete a particularly disputed fencing contract with John Mawbey. Later Jimmy Governor had a dispute with Mrs Mawbey over payment for rations and he told his wife Mrs Mawbey had cheated him. His wife also reported back conversations with Mrs Mawbey and Miss Kerz, who boarded with the Mawbeys, about his colour and Aboriginality. On 20 July 1900 Jimmy Governor and Underwood and his brother decided to do something about his grievances with the Mawbeys. He went to the Mawbey homestead and spoke to Mrs Mawbey and Miss Kerz. According to Jimmy Governor he asked Mrs Mawbey did you say my wife should be shots for marrying a blackfellow? She sneered and then Jimmy attacked her and Miss Kerz with a nulla nulla. The screams awoke the rest of the household and they came running to help. A number of others in the house were murdered but the three murderers escaped. A manhunt was organised to find the fleeing murderers. The two Governor men abandoned Underwood near Mendooran and Underwood was soon caught by police. 2,000 police were involved in the manhunt but the two Governor men avoided captured. They went to Gulgong and murder three people that Jimmy had once worked for and held a grievance against. They then went to Merriwa and murdered two family members of a man for whom Jimmy had once worked. They murdered a total of eleven people. Jimmy Governor was shot by the fiancé of Miss Kerz who was seeking revenge, but he escaped only to be found in a weakened state 8 days later and he was handed over to police. Three days later brother Joe Governor who had escaped was attacked and shot by a farmer near Muswellbrook. Jimmy Governor was tried in Sydney and hung on 16th January 1901 just two days after Jacky Underwood was hung in Dubbo gaol. Underwood murdered 14 year old Percy Mawbey a son of John Mawbey. Underwood was buried in the Catholic section of Dubbo cemetery. Jimmy Governor’s wife Ethel remarried and had nine children with her new husband.  The sad story was renamed in a novel by Thomas Keneally in 1972 as the Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith. Then in 1978 it was made into a major film directed by Fred Schepisi.

Whereas the Cage stands on a ridge to the North of the Hall, Paddock Cottage stands towards the end of a ridge about a bit less than a mile to the South-West of the Hall and commands stunning views. Of a similar height and shape to the Cage, Paddock Cottage is a much simpler affair. I read that it was constructed of stone quarried on the estate and, at one time it was used to house estate workers.
My first photo shows the cottage as I approached. The next three show it from three of  its sides  - I couldn’t get to the side behind the small lone tree because of the steep incline on that side.
I have seen a photograph offering a line-of-sight view of the Cage from Paddock Cottage, though I couldn’t see it when I looked - because of the trees (pictured in my fifth photo) in that direction.
The next three photos show views from the ridge close to Paddock Cottage – I’m fairly sure that the town pictured in the distance is Stockport where, earlier in the day, I’d photographed the railway viaduct.
From Paddock Cottage, I returned to the Hall via my outward path. As the Hall came into sight across the car park and Italianate garden, I noticed a small stream to my left that led  to a body of water that I believe to be the Fishing Lake and cottage though I can find nothing about them online to directly confirm my guess. In case you are wondering, I discovered -as I approached the lake edge - that the person standing there was taking photographs, not angling!
Today’s photographs conclude my posts about Lyme Hall. I hope that you have enjoyed walking with me.
In my next series, I return to Liverpool.

2523,,2022-09-29 13:35:22,6.0,"Sitting in a circle is one way to have a restorative meeting.  Everyone in the circle has time to speak and to get what they need from the meeting, while feeling supported by those who are there for them. Circles are often used when there is more than one person harmed or more than one person responsible – or for more community involvement or supporters to take part.

* Restorative justice can take place between a person who has experienced harm and the person who has caused that harm. But it can also be used to address secondary harm caused by organisations or systems, conflict experienced across a community group and/or circles of those who have experienced similar types of harm. This is often referred to as ‘restorative practice’ or a ‘restorative approach’.


Background:
Restorative justice is a voluntary process of supported contact between a person who has caused harm and someone who has experienced harm.
Where appropriate, this can also include their families and supporters.
Restorative justice can be considered by adults, children and young people in Scotland in a way which is responsive to trauma and takes a rights-based approach.
Restorative justice has many evidence-based benefits for those who have experienced harm and also those who have caused harm, their families and communities. These can include being given a choice, empowerment, recovery, improved wellbeing and the process can also help prevent people from causing further harm.
Research shows people in Scotland want the option of exploring restorative justice across a range of crime types, including those considered serious and sensitive in nature. This does not mean it will always go ahead, but even the choice is found to be empowering.
Restorative justice takes many forms, based on what is best for the parties involved, their needs and their continued safety. This is explored through the planning, preparation stages and continued risk assessment. Approaches include face-to-face conferences or meetings, letter-writing, video conferencing, ‘shuttle dialogue’ and healing circles.
Restorative justice does not always occur between a person who has experienced harm and/or a person who has caused that harm. It can also be used to address secondary harm caused by organisations or systems, conflict experienced across a community group and/or circles of those who have experienced similar types of harm. This is often referred to as ‘restorative practice’ or a ‘restorative approach’.
It’s a voluntary and consent-based process in Scotland and any party can discontinue their engagement in the process at any point without losing support from services in place, to ensure trauma-informed practice continues.
Restorative justice operates in parallel to the criminal justice and youth justice systems in Scotland and is never used an alternative to this. Outcomes achieved and/or agreed through restorative justice have no impact on any decisions taken throughout the criminal justice process.

2524,,2022-09-29 13:31:55,6.0,"Sitting in a circle is one way to have a restorative meeting.  Everyone in the circle has time to speak and to get what they need from the meeting, while feeling supported by those who are there for them. Circles are often used when there is more than one person harmed or more than one person responsible – or for more community involvement or supporters to take part.

* Restorative justice can take place between a person who has experienced harm and the person who has caused that harm. But it can also be used to address secondary harm caused by organisations or systems, conflict experienced across a community group and/or circles of those who have experienced similar types of harm. This is often referred to as ‘restorative practice’ or a ‘restorative approach’.


Background:
Restorative justice is a voluntary process of supported contact between a person who has caused harm and someone who has experienced harm.
Where appropriate, this can also include their families and supporters.
Restorative justice can be considered by adults, children and young people in Scotland in a way which is responsive to trauma and takes a rights-based approach.

Starting at the lower end of James Street, From the traffic lights, ready to cross to the Mann Island entrance to the Pierhead, I photographed the black, highly reflective Latitude and Longitude building blocks.
That led me to the Museum of Liverpool, The Liverpool Ferry building, The Liver and Cunard buildings and a group of sculptures. These included the ‘fab four’ Beatles statues and a statue of Captain John Walker, the merchant navy hero of the Battle of the Atlantic in World war ll. Other sculptures included two Lambananas; the ‘Heaven and Earth telescope and Orrery’; one dedicated to a Liverpool working cart-horse; finally one of a group including the propeller of RMS Lusitania.

Collecting photos of all The World Reimagined globes had required two trips – the second was last Saturday. I drove to Liverpool intending to photograph three of the inner-city ones – at the Albert Dock, Liverpool Central Library, and in Liverpool One. I parked in Albert Dock and, just as I stepped out of the car, it started raining – the Met office weather report for Liverpool that day had forecast &lt;=5% chance of rain! I’m a fair-weather photographer, so I wondered whether to climb back into the car and return home. I was less than 100 metres from the Martin Luther-King building and could see the globe from where I stood. The photographer in me said, ‘Stay’, so I got out of the car, donned my parka, flipped up the hood and took out my camera in its small Lowe bag.
I started with the Albert Dock globe then walked up towards Liverpool One to get the other two photos that I’d come for. I crossed from the Albert Dock to the central reservation of The Strand to Mann Island by the down-entrance to the Q-Park. From there, looking in the direction of the Liver Building, I photographed the black, modernistic Longitude building and the adjacent tower block, then crossed to Liverpool One to walk to the library – at least that was my intention, but I kept getting distracted by things that looked as if they wanted to be photographed.
Other than steps and passageways I liked the reflections I kept encountering – such as of the statues of Sir John and Cecil Moores in Church Street, and the paved list of book titles outside the library. By now I was enjoying working even in the showers – I just had to keep wiping my lens and replacing the lens cap after each shot. On my way back to Pierhead, I stopped to photograph the Imperial Building at the junction of Whitechapel and Victoria Street. It’s reminiscent of the FlatIron building in New York. The former central post office in Victoria Street was where, in my first job, I had to meet the bank security guards to collect mail each morning on my way in to work. The juxtaposition of the statue of Queen Victoria and the Queen Elizabeth ll Law courts also seemed to justify a photograph.  From there, it was only a few minutes’ walk down James Street to Mann Island.","['Landscape', 'Cityscape', 'city photos', 'Cities', 'street photography', 'streets', 'Liverpool', 'Merseyside']",150.0,2.0

The Royal Albert Dock is, to photographers, ‘a gift that keeps on giving’. Sadly, when I came to process my shots, some were irrecoverable because I hadn’t noticed raindrops on my lens when I’d been photographing. I’d taken shots of some views across the dock to Liverpool One when I’d first arrived, but on my return from the library, after I left Mann Island, I continued my photowalk around the dock.  I started as I passed the statues to sixties’ pop idol Billy Fury and to the Legacy Sculpture of the young emigrant family. I took more photographs when walking along cobbled Gower Street/Kings Parade behind the Tate Liverpool and the Albert Dock buildings. You may notice the Love Locks attached to the chain barriers.
I moved on to photograph the Wheel of Liverpool between the M&amp;S Arena and the Jury’s Inn hotel. While I was there, I took a shot of the colourful Peace Monument and reflections of the Wheel in a restaurant window. On my final leg of Albert Dock, I crossed via a small bridge to the Britannia Pavilion and its entrance to the Beatles Museum, continued to the old red post-box at the corner of Gower Street and Salthouse Quay.
I now had a nice view all the way along towards the Martin Luther-King building (and my car), with Salthouse Quay to my right. I took a photo of the red items adorning the Atlantic Pavilion, and of the Salthouse bridge. By now the rain had stopped for a while. As I returned to my car, I wished that it had done so three hours earlier.","['Landscape', 'Cityscape', 'city photos', 'docks', 'streets', 'Statues', 'sculptures', 'Royal-Albert-Dock', 'Albert-Dock', 'Liverpool', 'Merseyside']",125.0,0.0

Starting at the lower end of James Street, From the traffic lights, ready to cross to the Mann Island entrance to the Pierhead, I photographed the black, highly reflective Latitude and Longitude building blocks.
That led me to the Museum of Liverpool, The Liverpool Ferry building, The Liver and Cunard buildings and a group of sculptures. These included the ‘fab four’ Beatles statues and a statue of Captain John Walker, the merchant navy hero of the Battle of the Atlantic in World war ll. Other sculptures included two Lambananas; the ‘Heaven and Earth telescope and Orrery’; one dedicated to a Liverpool working cart-horse; finally one of a group including the propeller of RMS Lusitania.

Pretty Harrogate sits astride the Bremer River surrounded by high hills. Harrogate was one of the last strips and the most northerly of the land obtained by the Paringa Mining Company of Callington in the Mt Barker Mining Survey. In 1856 the Paringa Mining Company was sold to the Britannia Mining Company and Charles Young was employed to survey town blocks in Callington and elsewhere and to sell off some land for the Britannia Mining Company.   Harrogate on the Bremer was one of the spots chosen for the creation of town blocks to be sold off. Young was from Devon but named the new town after its namesake in Yorkshire. Other reports suggest that John Baker of Terlinga station near Tungkillo had purchased this section of land and that he authorised a township in 1858 and named it. He certainly bought land around Harrogate.  Yet another person, an early resident of the district from 1853 recalled Tom Carling claiming he named the town after Harrogate in Yorkshire! Regardless of who named the town it developed quickly with a Bible Christian Church (Methodist) opening in 1859. It soon had a private school in it with 40 pupils. The town got a public school in 1877 which closed in 1943. The quaint old stone hall opened in 1861 and is still a community hall.

Although some records say the quaint Appleton cottage was built in 1858 this seems unlikely. The Graber family moved to Harrogate in 1863 and presumably built a cottage then. The next year, 1864 Mr Graeber was killed in an accident and Artemus Appleton married widow Johanna Graeber in 1868 and either replaced the original cottage, or more likely added on to it.  It became known as Appleton Cottage and bake house. When Johanna died around 1875 Artemus Appleton married one of his Graeber step daughters and had another 11 children with her!  Appletons sold the cottage to the Schwab family in 1936. The old Post Office and store almost across the street opened around 1861. Until recently there had been no bitumen road into Harrogate but it is now linked to Woodside by bitumen.

The Museum of Liverpool is dedicated to the history of the city. Opened on 2011, it stands on Mann Island, facing a terminal section of the Leeds-Liverpool canal, the Three Graces buildings and the Mersey Ferry Terminal. Inside there is a varied collection of areas – including local public transport, local archaeology, history, art, women’s rights, and other social, historical and contemporary matters.
The photos include a nod to Valerie Jardin’s suggestion about featuring lines, patterns, silhouettes and photographing people from behind. One image shows the Museum’s large window, partly silhouetting a scale model of the original Lutyens design for the city’s Roman Catholic Cathedral.","['museums', 'Museum-of-Liverpool', 'Liverpool', 'Merseyside', 'Black and White']",98.0,0.0

Today I'm checking out the full length ballgowns hanging behind me, yet I'm wearing a shorter cocktail dress myself as it is a bit easier to move around in. It's a cute pink dress, very girly and decorated with lots of shiny beads, just the way I love it. Wearing it feels great, and seeing you again feels great too, so I'm all smiles. Happy Paula has returned.","['dress', 'gown', 'satin', 'silk', 'silky', 'shiny', 'colors', 'colorful', 'show', 'display', 'ballgown', 'skirt', 'sexy', 'hot', 'girl', 'lady', 'happy', 'joy', 'fun', 'smile', 'delight', 'elegance', 'beauty', 'sweet', 'cute', 'adorable', 'pink', 'tulle', 'beads', 't-girl', 'tranny', 'transvestite', 'sparkly', 'girly', 'feminine', 'soft', 'necklace', 'pretty']",2870.0,4.0

The Museum of Liverpool is dedicated to the history of the city. Opened on 2011, it stands on Mann Island, facing a terminal section of the Leeds-Liverpool canal, the Three Graces buildings and the Mersey Ferry Terminal. Inside there is a varied collection of areas – including local public transport, local archaeology, history, art, women’s rights, and other social, historical and contemporary matters.
The photos include a nod to Valerie Jardin’s suggestion about featuring lines, patterns, silhouettes and photographing people from behind. One image shows the Museum’s large window, partly silhouetting a scale model of the original Lutyens design for the city’s Roman Catholic Cathedral.","['museums', 'Museum-of-Liverpool', 'Liverpool', 'Merseyside', 'Black and White']",103.0,0.0

A couple of Sundays ago, I went with my wife, her daughter and Ted, the family Japanese Spitz dog to Norton Priory Museum &amp; Gardens in Runcorn, Cheshire. This was once the site of a medieval church and is said to be the most excavated monastic site in Europe. I’ve previously posted photos of the beautiful 12th century undercroft with its beautiful, vaulted ceiling.  The Priory was founded in 1134 and achieved mitred abbey status in 1391.
The museum among the thousands of objects discovered at the site is the twice life-size St Christopher statue, which may have been commissioned to mark the site’s being awarded abbey status in 1391.
The museum’s woodland walks are now open to the public and today’s posts are of part of the woodlands but include shots that I took in the museum of the St Christopher statue and of a Tudor period window. I also include two photos I took of a statue of a former monk – a gardener - in the woodland area.

Last weekend I spent two nights at the, now annual, River of Lights festival – two nights because on the Friday there were two artworks that I hadn’t been able to find. This year, more of the ten artworks were immersive – designed to allow visitors to wander around, touch and, in some cases, listen to. It was more difficult, because of this, to photograph the artworks without including the people interacting with them, but the festival is, after all, for visitors rather than for photographers. In any case, including the families simply made for a different kind of photography. There was one exhibit – Continuum – that I found particular difficult to photograph. It comprises a group of tall, cuboid, mirrored columns, poorly illuminated along the edges. People passing between the columns are reflected in them and so their passing makes it doubly difficult to photograph the artwork.
I’ve not listed the various installations – there is plenty of information online. For anyone who has been, some of my photos may look different from their experience because the colours and, in some cases, the shapes of some of the artworks change from moment to moment.

In the lower register, to the left is Bali facing the dwarf Vishnu, behind whom the figure with raised arms is Shukracarya, Bali’s guru.  He performs a water pouring ritual to certify Bali’s promise of three steps to the dwarf.

A few kilometres from Hamilton is the southern tip of the Grampian Ranges with the small towns of Dunkeld and Glenthompson which are incredibly Scottish in name and origins. What is now Dunkeld began with a Post Office in 1852 around a village named Mount Sturgeon. Two years later it was given a Scottish name instead. Dunkeld is close to Mt Abrupt (827 m) in the Serra Range of the Grampians. The first hotel in the district was the Woolpack Inn opened in 1845 but it was followed by four other hotels as the years passed. Dunkeld prospered because of the wool stations and because it was on the main route from Hamilton to Ballarat and Melbourne. The railway from Ararat reached here in 1877. Much of the town was destroyed in a major bushfire in 1944. But the basalt police lockup, morgue and stable and dunny built in 1860 survived but little else on the police site. The early basalt Presbyterian Church erected in 1865 survived and it is now the town museum. The railway station from 1877 on the Ararat to Hamilton railway survived as did the old bake house from the 19th century and several churches – the 1912 Wesleyan Methodist church, the 1913 Catholic Church and the original Anglican Church built in 1881. Even the late 19th centaur weatherboard Post Office survived.  The town has an excellent War Memorial with sculpture boards relating the linkage of the town and one of its young men with the Australian submarine the AE2 which operated at Gallipoli in 1915.  The town has good sporting facilities, and excellent Information Office and a stunning 1960s community hall made of colourful local stone.

3960,,2022-10-29 11:17:18,6.0,"Last Saturday, I took refuge from the rain in the World of Glass in St Helens, Merseyside. Opened in 2000, it includes a visitor centre, café, museum and public lending library. It results from a collaboration between the former Pilkingtons Glass Company and St Helens Borough Council. It sits on both sides of the St Helens Canal, linked by a glazed bridge. One side is a former Victorian glass factory furnace with tunnels beneath. The other side provides the library, café, a space for local art and daily demonstrations of glass-blowing. Some major exhibits include a large chandelier that was previously located in Manchester airport, and the optic from the decommissioned Clare Island lighthouse in Ireland.
The entrance to the site is through the huge, Grade II listed, Pilkington’s Jubilee Cone which was constructed in 1887 to house the first ever continuous glass making furnace.
My photos today show some of the museum’s many sides including the library, some museum exhibits, Bossanyi’s Dr Julius’ stained-glass panel, the chandelier and the former furnace. In the shot of the library you may notice the optic from the Clare Island lighthouse.
In tomorrow’s post I’ll attach my shots of a glass-blowing demonstration.
