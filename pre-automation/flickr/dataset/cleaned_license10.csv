This is what 75,000 newly hatched sac fry look like.

This bubbling bevy of baby salmon represents the next generation of tule fall Chinook that will eventually get released into the Columbia River.

About 50 days after fertilization, the sac fry hatch from the salmon eggs, discarding their white shells. The attached yolk sac provides food for the young fish as they grow and gradually disappears.

About three months after hatching the fish will be moved to rearing ponds at the hatchery.

Tule fall Chinook salmon are native to the lower Columbia River and its tributaries downstream of The Dalles Dam.

This video shows just one of many rearing boxes at Spring Creek National Fish Hatchery, about 65 miles east of Portland, Oregon, in the Columbia Gorge.

The hatchery produces 12.5 million tule fall Chinook salmon each year.

239,,2022-10-21 14:24:58,10,"Farm Lot 59 founder Sasha Kanno, an urban agriculture advocate, operates a half-acre urban farm that specializes in growing and selling rare and unusual varieties of flowers to support organic farming of traditional vegetables for those in need; to do this, they needed to extend their growing season; this is when they applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for two high tunnels and other technical support at their location in Long Beach, CA, on Oct. 21, 2022. The extended season means that in their first high tunnel, equipped to support bean and tomato plants; they can plant sweet peas in mid-October, harvest from February until beyond the traditional end of the season, and then transition to tomatoes. Without the high tunnels, they would have to plant in February and harvest months later in a shorter season.

They strive to serve as a center for community engagement and wellness. They do this by providing their community with the vegetables they grow. By serving vulnerable populations in the Long Beach community, they help with immediate food needs and inspire the community to eat and live
healthily.

Their sales and subscriptions from a roadside stand at Farm Lot 59 fund some of their non-profit organization. Additional sales through other outlets and direct donations also provide needed funds.

Their unlikely farm in Los Angeles County sits lower than the neighboring jack pumps for crude oil, industrial zones, recycling center, city park, and the cemetery. On a clear day, a view from the nearby park above them shows the cranes for container ships at the Port of Long Beach, five miles away.

The farm hosts educational, volunteer, and other events that bring together their community to learn about the benefits and
possibilities of urban farming and more. Since 2010 Farm Lot 59 has served the community by hosting thousands of youth in their outdoor education programming, where people can learn about growing food for themselves or others. The farm has incubated multiple small businesses and inspired farmers to go rural and go bigger. Kanno's community, civic and governmental engagement has helped change policies and fought for healthy food access.

The pandemic changed everything. Until March 2020, their crops were chef driven by what and when 12-15 restaurants wanted to serve specific produce. The focus and crops had to change, and they did. Since then, the farm has produced traditional organic fruit and vegetables to provide fresh food to address the community's food security during a pandemic. They have harvested more than 5,000 pounds of organic produce and donated more than 2,000 healthy meals. Partnering with Food Finders, they converted a shipping container into refrigerated storage at the Food Hub at the City's Admiral Kidd Park where 100% of their edible crops go.

The name &quot;Farm Lot 59&quot; directly references Long Beach's early agricultural past. Developers designated large areas of what was to become Long Beach and farm lots. The discovery of oil changed plans, and lots were subdivided again for housing. Then the land became part of the City's water infrastructure. But, because of its topography and role in the City's municipal water infrastructure, Farm Lot 59 was never developed into a farm or home and remained owned by the City of Long Beach to this day. Farm Lot 59 was built on the remnants of an illegal dump. The abandoned parcel was cleaned up with help from the City of Long Beach, which replaced the dirt with clean fill soil. Once the rubbish was removed, they planted the first seeds in the Spring of 2012.

Kanno's advocacy for local food policy and making the operation an example of urban farming was instrumental in the adoption of AB 551 and in modernizing the City's agriculture ordinance. She works together with many diverse organizations, representatives of local and regional governments, public agencies, other farmers, ranchers, and agricultural
businesses. This collaborative work has changed local food access and
production in Long Beach. She participates with the USDA Farm Services Agency County Committee and plans to increase her participation in policy and advocacy programs.

 &quot;Our farm demonstrates a small-scale model of regenerative agriculture using current and best practices,… says Kanno. We're working to change the future of food by proving that vacant property can be transformed into a sustainable urban farmscape….&quot;

Farm Lot 59 is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2010.

525,NORTHERN IRELAND....,2022-10-28 14:04:32,10,"Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.
It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers' quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.",[],0,0

663,NORTHERN IRELAND....,2022-10-28 14:05:09,10,"Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.
It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers' quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.",[],2,0

757,NORTHERN IRELAND....,2022-10-28 14:01:13,10,"Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.
It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers' quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.",[],0,0

829,NORTHERN IRELAND....,2022-10-28 14:03:22,10,"Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.
It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers' quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.",[],0,0

893,NORTHERN IRELAND....,2022-10-28 13:53:11,10,"Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.
It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers' quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.",[],0,0

929,,2022-10-21 14:37:06,10,"Farm Lot 59 founder Sasha Kanno, an urban agriculture advocate, operates a half-acre urban farm that specializes in growing and selling rare and unusual varieties of flowers to support organic farming of traditional vegetables for those in need; to do this, they needed to extend their growing season; this is when they applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for two high tunnels and other technical support at their location in Long Beach, CA, on Oct. 21, 2022. The extended season means that in their first high tunnel, equipped to support bean and tomato plants; they can plant sweet peas in mid-October, harvest from February until beyond the traditional end of the season, and then transition to tomatoes. Without the high tunnels, they would have to plant in February and harvest months later in a shorter season.

They strive to serve as a center for community engagement and wellness. They do this by providing their community with the vegetables they grow. By serving vulnerable populations in the Long Beach community, they help with immediate food needs and inspire the community to eat and live
healthily.

Their sales and subscriptions from a roadside stand at Farm Lot 59 fund some of their non-profit organization. Additional sales through other outlets and direct donations also provide needed funds.

Their unlikely farm in Los Angeles County sits lower than the neighboring jack pumps for crude oil, industrial zones, recycling center, city park, and the cemetery. On a clear day, a view from the nearby park above them shows the cranes for container ships at the Port of Long Beach, five miles away.

The farm hosts educational, volunteer, and other events that bring together their community to learn about the benefits and
possibilities of urban farming and more. Since 2010 Farm Lot 59 has served the community by hosting thousands of youth in their outdoor education programming, where people can learn about growing food for themselves or others. The farm has incubated multiple small businesses and inspired farmers to go rural and go bigger. Kanno's community, civic and governmental engagement has helped change policies and fought for healthy food access.

The pandemic changed everything. Until March 2020, their crops were chef driven by what and when 12-15 restaurants wanted to serve specific produce. The focus and crops had to change, and they did. Since then, the farm has produced traditional organic fruit and vegetables to provide fresh food to address the community's food security during a pandemic. They have harvested more than 5,000 pounds of organic produce and donated more than 2,000 healthy meals. Partnering with Food Finders, they converted a shipping container into refrigerated storage at the Food Hub at the City's Admiral Kidd Park where 100% of their edible crops go.

The name &quot;Farm Lot 59&quot; directly references Long Beach's early agricultural past. Developers designated large areas of what was to become Long Beach and farm lots. The discovery of oil changed plans, and lots were subdivided again for housing. Then the land became part of the City's water infrastructure. But, because of its topography and role in the City's municipal water infrastructure, Farm Lot 59 was never developed into a farm or home and remained owned by the City of Long Beach to this day. Farm Lot 59 was built on the remnants of an illegal dump. The abandoned parcel was cleaned up with help from the City of Long Beach, which replaced the dirt with clean fill soil. Once the rubbish was removed, they planted the first seeds in the Spring of 2012.

Kanno's advocacy for local food policy and making the operation an example of urban farming was instrumental in the adoption of AB 551 and in modernizing the City's agriculture ordinance. She works together with many diverse organizations, representatives of local and regional governments, public agencies, other farmers, ranchers, and agricultural
businesses. This collaborative work has changed local food access and
production in Long Beach. She participates with the USDA Farm Services Agency County Committee and plans to increase her participation in policy and advocacy programs.

 &quot;Our farm demonstrates a small-scale model of regenerative agriculture using current and best practices,… says Kanno. We're working to change the future of food by proving that vacant property can be transformed into a sustainable urban farmscape….&quot;

Farm Lot 59 is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2010.

Since 1997, Urban Roots has provided paid internships to youth on the East Side of Saint Paul. Youth interns develop leadership, entrepreneurial, and life skills through their Market Garden, Conservation, and Cook Fresh Programs. Each year, 75 youth interns, ages 14-24, participate in their progressive, tiered programming, connecting to one another and to the world around them.

Urban Roots promote entrepreneurship by teaching youth interns to manage gardens and crops for distribution to community supported agriculture (CSA) shares, Farmers Market, Roots for the Home Team, hunger relief efforts, youth families, restaurants and small-batch food preservation for seasonal sales.  Program participants are also involved in creating sales and marketing materials for the Farmer’s Market and other retail outlets. (USDA photo by Christophe Paul)

Since 1997, Urban Roots has provided paid internships to youth on the East Side of Saint Paul. Youth interns develop leadership, entrepreneurial, and life skills through their Market Garden, Conservation, and Cook Fresh Programs. Each year, 75 youth interns, ages 14-24, participate in their progressive, tiered programming, connecting to one another and to the world around them.

Urban Roots promote entrepreneurship by teaching youth interns to manage gardens and crops for distribution to community supported agriculture (CSA) shares, Farmers Market, Roots for the Home Team, hunger relief efforts, youth families, restaurants and small-batch food preservation for seasonal sales.  Program participants are also involved in creating sales and marketing materials for the Farmer’s Market and other retail outlets. (USDA photo by Christophe Paul)

It is also a great way to get involved in bat conservation, which is why the bat houses pictured here were recently installed on BLM California public lands.

Habitat loss is a major problem for bats, and putting up a bat house in your own yard can give local bats a safe and comfortable place to live.

3424,"Victoria, Canada",2022-09-12 04:06:07,10,"The Louvre Museum is the world's most-visited museum, and a historic landmark in Paris, France. It is the home of some of the best-known works of art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). At any given point in time, approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet). Attendance in 2021 was 2.8 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic, up five percent from 2020, but far below pre-COVID attendance. Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2021.

The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.

The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.

The Musée du Louvre contains more than 380,000 objects and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600 square metres (652,000 sq ft) dedicated to the permanent collection. The Louvre exhibits sculptures, objets d'art, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds.",[],13,0

تفاركنا من بعد العشك والحب هذاكة
كل واحد بحاله مشى وفض الشراكة
بيناتنا كل البقى عشرتنا ذكرى
ويجور تره هم تنسي من بعد فترة
لو ادري بوعودك جذب ما صدكتها
ما امن و روحي الك ما سلمتها
تكسرني ابد ما توقعت ما حسبتها
كلمة حبيبي من قلب ظني كلتها
ماضي صرت بالنسبة الك وانت صرت ماضي
المهم انت بخير هسه وبالبعد راضي
ما راح اشغلك بأي كلام وبأي حجي فاضي
المهم انت بخير هسه وبالبعد راضي
وانا روحي عزيزة وما تطخ راس ولا تنذل
تهملني واحبك حتى الله بهاي ما يقبل
المشاعر زحمة كلش عيب اذا من عندك اطلبها
لا تظن اني راح اترجى بيك تردلي واتوسل
تذكر قبل انت شكلت لمن كعدنا
اوعدني ما تروح لبشر غيري وتحضنه
واكتبلي بأوراق الشجر انت الكلتها
كلمة حبيبي بالورق شو شككتها
تذكر قبل انت شكلت لمن كعدنا
اوعدني ما تروح لبشر غيري وتحضنه
واكتبلي بأوراق الشجر انت الكلتها
كلمة حبيبي بالورق شو شككتها
وانا روحي عزيزة وما تطخ راس ولا تنذل
تهملني واحبك حتى الله بهاي ما يقبل

ما تناساها الخفوق .. ولا نساها
لي معاها قبل ما تغرب حياة
واغرقت شمس المحبه في مساها
يا عيون الشوق وين الأمنيات
يا عساها بداخل عيونك عساها
هل هي تذكرني أو ان الشوق مات؟
أو زمان الصمت بالقسوه كساها
أسأل الأيام عنها: كيف جات؟
وكيف راحت والزمن كيف انتساها
من يجمّعني بعد هذا الشتات؟
أو يواسيني .. ويهديني وساها
تهت في بحر الشعر .. والأغنيات
لا معي مينا .. ولا قلبي رساها

ما لقيت الاّ من الذكرى صداها

جيتي عند اللي يقدر قيمتك
اللي فتح لك قلبه
تاتا تاتا في القلب إتسحبتي
دا انتي بتجري في دمي
ببساطه أنا راهنتك وكسبتك
جامده ومش بتسمي
إسألي ناس قبلك عن هيبتي
الشوق آخر همي
ولا يملى عنيا غيرك بس
ومقاسمك عمري أنا بالنص
دا كلام من القلب دا مش رص
ورد على خدودك يترص
ولا يملى عنيا غيرك بس
ومقاسمك عمري أنا بالنص
دا كلام من القلب دا مش رص
ورد على خدودك يترص
ليكي عندي الصبح وأنا بصبح
حضن كبير هاتوصى
وأداريكي في القلب وفي عنيا
لسه هفاجئك لسه
من أول كلمه أنا ترجمتك
لآ من أول بصه
أنا كده عديت متهيألي
إن انا كده خدت اللقطه
عيني عيني ده كتير والله عليا
دا انتي هديه ولُقطه
لو اقول لك قمر أبقى ظلمتك
جبتي لغيرك نقطه
ولا يملى عنيا غيرك بس
ومقاسمك عمري أنا بالنص

ندرا عليا
لهرب خلصت في الحيط لبست
وهقول نصيبي
وهقول دا تيست واتيز ذا بيست
وسين ولام وألف وميم
وسلام سلام من أربع حروف
كل اللي عدّا سموه ظروف
كان ضاع في لحظه أو قولو خوف
ندرنٍ عليا لادبح خروف
مانا ادبيست مانا ادبيست
في الفترة ديا
فكت وروقت بالعكس فوقت
كان أولى بيا
من بدري اكت أو أربي قط

Retaining its original gate posts the exterior is well preserved. A 1903 resident there, Mr. Arthur Scholfield, was named as a Justice of the Peace in January 1917.

The house boasted 7 bedrooms; the hall leads to a stairway, a large living room, sitting room, kitchen, utility room, laundry, 2 dressing rooms, cellars and garage. A laid-out garden completed its description.

Added features included; a cast iron fireplace and a mahogany fireplace, the dining and sitting rooms were serviced by a retractable screen which could be opened up to form one huge room. The house was taken by the Spastic Society for a while; they changed to calling this Meade House.","['Urmston', 'Flixton', 'Davyhulme']",26,0

Cuando este falleció en 1745, su viuda lo donó a Felipe V. La finca tiene un olivar y en su tiempo se llegó a instalar una almazara para el aprovechamiento del aceite además de frutales y naranjos. Es un lugar idóneo que invita al paseo entre el Palacete y la Puerta de El Pardo. Esta foto es de sus olivos ese árbol milenario de la sabiduría, una fuente de riqueza y alimento desde hace milenios. Un símbolo de nuestra cultura.

Quinta de El Pardo estate. The palace, built in the middle of the mountain, was bought in 1717 by the Duke of Arco Alonso Manrique de Lara. When he died in 1745, his widow donated it to Philip V. The estate has an olive grove and in its time an oil mill was installed to make use of the oil, as well as fruit and orange trees. It is an ideal place for a stroll between the Palacete and the Puerta de El Pardo. This photo is of its olive trees, that millenary tree of wisdom, a source of wealth and food for millennia. A symbol of our culture.

5436,,2021-12-08 11:25:50,9,"Billions of years ago, a river flowed across this scene in Mawrth Vallis. Like on Earth, these river beds can get filled up with rocks that are cemented together. After Mars became a colder, drier place and the river disappeared, the rocky river bed remained.

In this HiRISE image, we see a dark ridge snaking across the surface. The dark ridge is the old river bed. It is raised above its surroundings now because these softer surroundings have been eroded away, whereas the rocky river bed resists that. Scientists call these ridges inverted channels and many of them are visible in this area of Mars.

Image is less than 1 km (less than 1 mi) across and is 286 km above surface.

En 1982 la nueva dirección de la fábrica, recordando éxitos comerciales de aquella Explorer quiso repetir la jugada y con base en la exitosa trialera TR/80 realizó esta Tu-Yo en cuyo nombre quería representarse ocio a duo. Técnicamente una gran moto que partía de una gran base, pero que estéticamente no convenció con un asiento excesivo para el pequeño depósito de trial y un útil pero poco atractivo trasportín trasero para llevar ahí paquetes en ciudad o la merienda al campo.

El trial o el cross son deportes muy atractivos, pero exigentes tanto para la moto como para el piloto.
El todo terreno también lo es; la moto puede ser más cómoda pero es igualmente potente y excesiva para muchos usuarios.
Sin embargo pasear por el monte en moto es un placer que podía estar en las manos de muchos: se trataba de hacer motos accesibles para cualquiera;  motos que podías emplear en tu día a día en la ciudad o en las incipientes urbanizaciones y salir al campo con ellas, con comodidad, acompañado si querías. Motos que derivaban de las empleadas en trial en muchos casos pero todas las veces derivadas de diseños nacidos para el todo-terreno e incluso, una vez más motos de carretera adaptadas a este nuevo uso.

5576,"Los Angeles, CA, USA",2022-01-18 10:23:13,9,"LOS ANGELES - Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Council President Nury Martinez announced on January 18, 2022 that Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas will retire after nearly 40 years of distinguished service to the Los Angeles Fire Department — and that Kristin Crowley, a top deputy with a stellar 25-year track record at the  Department, has been nominated as its next Chief.

If confirmed by the City Council, Crowley, currently Acting Administrative Operations Chief Deputy and Fire Marshal, will be the 19th Fire Chief, and the first woman to ever lead the LAFD.

“We’re living through an unprecedented moment that has called on our Fire Department not just to protect us – but to lead us in the fight to overcome  public safety challenges we’ve never faced before. At the same time, the LAFD is leading a transformative national discussion about strengthening equity  and inclusion within the firefighting ranks, and we must overcome those internal challenges too,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “Throughout her distinguished career, Kristin Crowley has proven her brilliance, determination and bravery on the job again and again. She’s also shown this city her heart, with her tireless commitment to helping students access life-changing educational opportunities. There is no one better equipped to  lead the LAFD at this moment than Kristin. She’s ready to make history, and I’m proud to nominate her as the Department’s next Chief.”

“Today is a big moment in this City. For the first time in its history the Los Angeles Fire Department will be led by a woman,” said Council President  Martinez. “Chief Kristin Crowley is known by her colleagues and by this city as someone who is dedicated, hard working, and goes above and beyond what is expected of her. This announcement is not just important for the City of Los Angeles, but for girls across LA who never imagined they could one day serve as Chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department.”

Crowley is a 22-year veteran of the Fire Department who has moved seamlessly through the ranks, proving her credibility and character along the way. She made history as the Department’s first female Fire Marshal and is the second woman to earn the rank of Chief Deputy.

Chief Deputy Crowley, who serves as program director for the LAFD’s youth development program, has played a key role in ensuring that over 1,000 LAUSD high school students continue in their education.

In her current role, she helped to develop a five-year strategic plan to identify areas of growth within the Department and foster culture more open to change. As Chief, she plans to work to both deepen existing efforts and create new mechanisms to foster equity and inclusion in the Department.

&quot;I am honored and humbled by the opportunity to be the next Fire Chief of the Los Angeles City Fire Department and to lead the Department into the future,&quot; Crowley said. &quot;As the Fire Chief, if confirmed, I vow to take a strategic and balanced approach to ensure we meet the needs of the community we serve. We will focus our efforts on increasing our operational effectiveness, enhancing firefighter safety and well-being, and fully commit to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture within the LAFD. Thank you, Mayor Garcetti, Council President Martinez, and Chief Terrazas for entrusting me to lead and to work with the dedicated women and men of the finest department in the world.&quot;

Chief Terrazas, who was sworn in as L.A.’s Fire Chief in 2014, was the first Latino to serve in that role. A 39-year veteran of the Department, Chief  Terrazas helped steer the City through some of its greatest challenges, and brought about meaningful advancements and innovations within the Fire Department.

Under his leadership, LAFD supervised the City’s free public COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs, which has administered nearly 4.86 million tests and approximately 1.43 million vaccinations to date. The City of L.A.’s testing effort was the nation’s largest municipal testing program and tested over 40,000 Angelenos per day at its peak.

“Ralph Terrazas has dedicated his life to keeping the people of Los Angeles safe. For nearly 40 years, he has served our Fire Department with bravery, determination and compassion for the Angelenos he’s sworn to protect,” said Mayor Garcetti. “I couldn’t imagine having anyone else as Fire Chief, through some of the most difficult fire and public safety challenges L.A. has ever faced. And when a once-in-a-century pandemic hit, Ralph’s leadership and bold action helped us save countless lives. I am honored to have served alongside him, and I know the mark he’s left on this city will never be forgotten.”

Early in his time leading LAFD, Chief Terrazas oversaw the rebuilding of the Department, which had stopped hiring new firefighters for five years as a result of the Great Recession. In 2015, he successfully reorganized the Department into four bureaus – the first restructuring of LAFD in 50 years, which helped to enhance accountability and improve service delivery.

Chief Terrazas also launched and implemented a variety of innovative initiatives, including Advanced Provider Response Units, Alternate Destination Response Units, and Fast Response Vehicles, efforts that enable firefighters to go beyond simply bringing patients to emergency rooms. Chief Terrazas has also made diversity a top priority – for the first time in department history, 51.4% firefighters are now people of color. Since 2014, the Department has maintained a steady increase in the number of hired sworn women at LAFD. Of the current sworn force, more than half of those who are currently employed were hired on in the last 8 years, and nearly 10% were brought on in 2021.

&quot;It was a privilege to serve as the Fire Chief of this world-class Department,&quot; said Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas. &quot;For nearly eight years, we made considerable strides in technology, implemented innovative ways to respond to emergencies, and became a model for other agencies. Chief  Crowley is an exemplary leader and has a broad base of experience that will serve the Department well. She has risen through the ranks over the past 26 years and I proudly promoted her three times during my tenure because she demonstrated a commitment to advancing the Department. Chief Crowley has been successful at every position and I expect her success to continue as the next Fire Chief.&quot;

6013,"Flagstaff, AZ",2019-12-11 16:35:54,9,"View of Munds Mountain, a bit of Mitten Ridge, and Bear Wallow Canyon from Hangover Trail. Beautiful hike across Sedona's Mitten Ridge. Starting from Cow Pies Trailhead, the trail crosses cowpie shaped rock formations, and joins up with what the Forest Service adopted and &quot;improved&quot; as &quot;Hangover Trail&quot; (but was known to hikers as Mitten Ridge Trail). Hangover Trail skirts along the base of Mitten Ridge on the Bear Wallow Canyon side of the ridge, jumping over the saddle to the Oak Creek Canyon side to continue around the end of the ridge back to Schnebly Hill Road and Munds Wagon Trail.

Note for mountain bikers: due to the very narrow portions of this trail, Hangover is one-way (east to west). A loop is typically ridden from Huckaby Trailhead up Munds Wagon to Cow Pies to Hangover back to Munds Wagon to return to the trailhead.

The parties discussed the state of the Ukrainian economy in the second month of our country's resistance to Russia's military invasion, as well as considered forecasts for its development in the near future.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ukrainian state spends about $ 10 billion a month on hostilities. The sources of expenditure financing were discussed at the meeting, including own tax revenues and assistance from Ukraine's international partners. In the same context, the prospects for the transition to a simplified taxation system scheduled for April were touched upon.
The participants of the meeting also discussed the sowing campaign, in particular the provision of fuel to farmers. Ways to diversify fuel imports and protect Ukraine's energy infrastructure from Russian military bombing were discussed.","['Ukraine', 'Kyiv', 'Zelenskyy', 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy']",1849,0

The World War I Somme American Cemetery in France is sited on a gentle slope typical of the open, rolling Picardie countryside. The 14.3-acre cemetery contains the graves of 1,844 of our military dead. Most lost their lives while serving in American units attached to British armies, or in operations near Cantigny. The headstones, set in regular rows, are separated into four plots by paths that intersect at the flagpole near the top of the slope. The longer axis leads to the chapel at the eastern end of the cemetery.

A massive bronze door surmounted by an American eagle leads into the chapel, whose outer walls contain sculptured pieces of military equipment. Once inside, light from a cross-shaped crystal window above the marble altar bathes the subdued interior with light. The walls bear the names of 333 of the missing. A rosette marks the name of the soldier listed on the Walls of the Missing that has since been recovered and identified.

Située à 20 minutes en voiture du centre de Las Palmas, au Nord-est de l'île de Gran Canaria, Bandama est un lieu vraiment impressionnant, avec son fond concave de bois d'arbres autochtones, ses vastes dépôts de cendres volcaniques grisâtres et les rochers escarpés au bord.

Près du bord escarpé de la caldera, le pic de Bandama mesure jusqu'à 575 mètres de hauteur. Il s'agit du cône volcanique le plus récent de Gran Canaria, et c'est aussi son meilleur belvédère. Pour pénétrer dans la caldera, il faut utiliser le petit réseau de sentiers qui la parcourt. Tout au long des 170 mètres de descente jusqu'au fond, vous pourrez entrevoir des grottes qu'utilisaient les anciens canariens pour entreposer les grains, des pressoirs pour écraser les raisins cultivés à Bandama et quelques maisons de centaines d'années d’histoire.",[],45,0

On y observe également quelques spécimens d'eucalyptus. Le volcan ou montagne de Arucas a formé, au fil de ses éruptions, la plaine de Arucas, zone gorgée de sédiments et découpée de petits caps, dont celui de la Punta de Camello. Les abords de la localité sont éclatants de beauté, comme le montre le Barranco de Los Palmitos, impressionnante palmeraie, et le Lomo de Riquiánez.",[],39,0

7195,,2019-03-19 11:37:21,9,"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. In coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers revealed that they succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of the supermassive black hole in the centre of Messier 87 and its shadow. The shadow of a black hole seen here is the closest we can come to an image of the black hole itself, a completely dark object from which light cannot escape. The black hole’s boundary — the event horizon from which the EHT takes its name — is around 2.5 times smaller than the shadow it casts and measures just under 40 billion km across. While this may sound large, this ring is only about 40 microarcseconds across — equivalent to measuring the length of a credit card on the surface of the Moon. Although the telescopes making up the EHT are not physically connected, they are able to synchronize their recorded data with atomic clocks — hydrogen masers — which precisely time their observations. These observations were collected at a wavelength of 1.3 mm during a 2017 global campaign. Each telescope of the EHT produced enormous amounts of data – roughly 350 terabytes per day – which was stored on high-performance helium-filled hard drives. These data were flown to highly specialised supercomputers — known as correlators — at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory to be combined.

📋WHAT ? 🔽
ℹ️ Dead Space is a 2008 survival horror video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows as the debut entry in the Dead Space series. Set on a mining spaceship overrun by deadly monsters called Necromorphs released following the discovery of an artifact called the Marker, the player controls engineer Isaac Clarke as he navigates the spaceship and fights the Necromorphs while struggling with growing psychosis. Gameplay has Isaac exploring different areas through its narrative, solving environmental puzzles and finding ammunition and equipment to survive.

Dead Space was pitched in early 2006, with an early prototype running on Xbox. Creator Glen Schofield wanted to make the most frightening horror game he could imagine, drawing inspiration from the video game Resident Evil 4 and films including Event Horizon and Solaris. The team pushed for innovation and realism in their design, ranging from procedural enemy placement to removing HUD elements. The sound design was a particular focus during production, with the score by Jason Graves designed to evoke tension and unease.

Dead Space debuted to slow sales but eventually sold over a million copies worldwide. Critics praised its atmosphere, gameplay and sound design. It won and was nominated for multiple industry awards and has been ranked by journalists as one of the greatest video games ever made. The series spawned two numbered sequels (released in 2011 and 2013), several spin-off titles, and other related media, including a comic book prequel and an animated film. A remake is currently in development by EA's Motive Studios and set for release in 2023.
