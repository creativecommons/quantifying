74,Washington DC,2022-09-28 19:15:27,4.0,"On Wednesday, September 28, 2022, at the University of Mississippi’s Gertrude C. Ford Center, Mr. James Meredith was recognized by both that educational institution and the U.S. Marshals Service. With the 60th anniversary of the integration of the University approaching on October 1, the institutional ceremony, entitled “The Mission Continues-Building Upon the Legacy,” gave USMS Director Ronald L. Davis the perfect opportunity to award Meredith one of highest honors he could, and made him an Honorary Deputy U.S. Marshal. In the history of the U.S. Marshals Service only a handful of people have ever received this honor.

 Of the approximately 350 deputy U.S. marshals and deputized personnel that ensured the registration and safety of Mr. Meredith during this time, few are living today. Retired Deputy U.S. Marshal Herschel Garner, the youngest of the cadre of deputies present during the riots that preceded registration, attended the ceremony representing all of them.

This historical event continues the partnership between the USMS and the University of Mississippi in recognizing the importance of educational equality and the role of our deputies in bringing this about. While it truly was a battle that resulted in Mr. Meredith attending and graduating from the school of his choice, the decade celebrations from 2002 to 2022 remain important moments in their own right.

137,,2022-09-20 13:33:43,4.0,"When Scott Thompson bought Blackberry Bog Farm, it was densely covered in blackberry bushes. As Thompson worked to revitalize the farm, he beat back the blackberry bushes and uncovered the oasis homesteaders found in the 1880s.

Today Blackberry Bog Farm grows over 648 different plant species which are sold at the farm stand on site, in local farmers markets and through CSAs. Thompson and his staff of about 15 locals tend to berry bushes, grape vines, and fruit trees, along with the variety of vegetables. Thompson still raises cows, chickens, and other poultry along with his extensive harvest. One of his goals is to diversify production on the farm's 29 acres as much as possible, as that will allow him to continue to sell locally to the approximately 47,000 residents of Clatsop County.

His work with NRCS Oregon started in 2017 with a seasonal high tunnel project. Funded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), seasonal high tunnels extend the growing season throughout the year, allowing producers to grow in a more stable environment through seasonal changes and variations. The high tunnel allowed Thompson to grow plants like habaneros, serranoes, and the squash that create the loofahs you see in your bathtub, amongst others. Thompson built a second high tunnel with NRCS in YEAR, in which he currently grows zucchini, melons, turmeric, and sweet potatoes that please not only customers, but also the cows that enjoy eating the vines.

Bruce Moffatt is NRCS Oregon’s District Conservationist in Clatsop County, assisting Thompson with his natural resource needs. Thompson’s most recent project with NRCS Oregon was installing over 1,000 feet of pollinator plantings along Bear Creek with EQIP funding. Across from the plant stand where Thompson and team sold drive-thru Mother’s Day bouquets during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, pollinators are drawn to this patch of a variety of native plants including yarrow, Puget gumweed, and Douglas aster.

Bear Creek, the city of Astoria’s water source, weaves through the property and provides habitat to wildlife and critters.  “If you wait here long enough, you’ll see a salmon swim up from the Pacific to spawn,” says Thompson. “The other day I saw an otter pull a big salmon from the creek and eat it along the banks of the shore.”

Pollinators and salmon aren’t the only visitors to Blackberry Bog Farm, however. The farm is the site of the first agro-tourism in the area as visitors enjoy farm to table dinners with a chef cooking in the plant yard, the onsite bakery, the nursery, build your own hanging basket events, and more. Visitors no longer visit the farm via boat on the river but take the gravel road off Hwy 30 near Astoria past the sign that reads, “Drive like your calf lives here.” There you’ll likely see Thompson walking, between the nursery and the pollinator plantings, busy as a bee.",[],415.0,0.0

Nancy is the prefecture of the northeastern French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle. It was the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine which was annexed by France under King Louis XV in 1766 and replaced by a province with Nancy maintained as capital. Following its rise to prominence in the Age of Enlightenment, it was nicknamed the &quot;capital of Eastern France&quot; in the late 19th century. The metropolitan area of Nancy had a population of 511,257 inhabitants at the 2018 census, making it the 16th-largest functional urban area in France and Lorraine's largest. The population of the city of Nancy proper is 104,885.

The motto of the city is Non inultus premor, Latin for '&quot;I am not injured unavenged&quot;'—a reference to the thistle, which is a symbol of Lorraine. Place Stanislas, a large square built between 1752 and 1756 by architect Emmanuel Héré under the direction of Stanislaus I of Poland to link the medieval old town of Nancy and the new city built under Charles III, Duke of Lorraine in the 17th century, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the first square in France to be given this distinction. The city also has many buildings listed as historical monuments and is one of the European centres of Art Nouveau thanks to the École de Nancy. Nancy is also a large university city; with the Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brabois, the conurbation is home to one of the main health centres in Europe, renowned for its innovations in surgical robotics.

Place Stanislas is a large pedestrianised square in the French city of Nancy, in the Lorraine historic region. Built between 1752 and 1756 on the orders of Stanisław Leszczyński, the square is one of oldest examples of an architecturally consistent and monumental public square, and is an excellent example of 18th-century urban architecture. Since 1983, the architectural ensemble comprising Place Stanislas, the extension of its axis, the Place de la Carrière and the Place d'Alliance, has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The square was a major project in urban planning, conceived by Stanislaus I of Poland as a way to link the medieval old town of Nancy and the &quot;new&quot; town built in the 17th century under Charles III, Duke of Lorraine. The square was also intended as a place royale to honour Stanislaus' son-in-law, Louis XV. The design created a large urban square or place that linked two handsome existing buildings: the Hôtel de Ville (city hall, now centred on its grand square) and the Hôtel du Gouvernement, the seat of the duchy. The seat of city government and the seat of Ducal government thus faced each other as complements through a series of rational, symmetrical but varied urban spaces, unequalled in Europe at the time.

The Place Stanislas is 125 metre long and 106 metre wide. It is paved with light ochre stones, with two lines of darker stones forming a diagonal cross motif. The square and the surrounding buildings, unified by their colossal orders, were designed by the royal architect Emmanuel Héré de Corny (1705–1763). Construction began in March 1752, and ended in November 1755. Barthélémy Guibal and Paul-Louis Cyfflé created a bronze statue of Louis XV that was erected in the center of the square. It was removed during the iconoclasm of the Revolution, when it was replaced with a simple winged figure. The square was renamed 'Place du Peuple', and later 'Place Napoléon'.

In 1831, a bronze statue of Stanislaus was placed in the middle of the square; since then it has been known as the 'Place Stanislas'.

Santa Maria Coronango
Estado de Puebla,México

En el territorio que actualmente ocupa el municipio de Coronango se establecieron en este lugar grupos de tlaxcaltecas y cholultecas, ocupando lo que es hoy los barrios de Analco, Cuapilco y San Antonio.

Se hallaron vestigios de tlaxcaltecas y cholultecas en este municipio, puesto que se han encontrado objetos de barro como platos, cazuelas, ollas, caritas, etcétera, con pinturas con el nombre de su cultura. Estos objetos los encontraron principalmente campesinos, al trabajar las tierras de cultivo.

Otra prueba de la influencia de los tlaxcaltecas y cholultecas en el municipio son los apellidos predominantes entre la mayoría de sus pobladores tales como: Tlaxcaltécal, Coyotécatl y Xochimitl, entre otros.

Bajo la dirección de Silverio Flores, en 1521 se inició la construcción de la Iglesia de Santa María de la Asunción, que se terminó en 1707. La fiesta patronal se realiza de forma anual el 15 de agosto. ",['Arquidiócesis de Puebla'],108.0,0.0

Built in 1822, the accommodation or barrack block is situated in the low ground behind the rock where the signal station is built. The barracks would have housed coastguard personnel and their families as they operated shifts, or watches, in the signal station. In 1920 the barracks and station were raided by a large IRA group who stole weapons, ammunition and other equipment. The set light to the barracks before they departed, worried that it would be used to accommodate British auxiliary troops fighting against the Republican Army in their struggle. None of the coastguard families were reported injured in the raid, but the barracks was abandoned after that.

On top of the hill stands the signal station on the site of a much earlier structure and beacon. What remains today is a complex little site, exposed to the Irish marine weather, but one that is remarkable intact. The keepers cottage sits in the middle of a stone wall compound, with a small observation post to the front, and a double latrine to the rear. There are other tantalising artefacts around the site such as a &quot;Post Office Telephone&quot; manhole cover, numerous stay fasts for flagpoles or antennae, a possible signal lamp mount, and a wooden latrine seat in one of the cubicles.

Both the barracks and signal station are on agricultural land, with open access to the signal station. There is a car park at the base of the hill.

Partners involved in this restoration project include the National Park Service, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Conservation Northwest, the Calgary Zoo, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, Washington's National Park Fund, Pittman-Robertson Funds and State Wildlife Grants, and State Personalized License Plates, among others.

It provided a forum for those working closely with arms trade issues nationally to discuss with their regional counterparts the potential linkages between the Arms Trade Treaty and issues specific to the sub-region. For the Southern Africa training, these issues included wildlife poaching and gender-based violence. The ATT Academy was organized by the Namibian Ministry of Defence and Control Arms, with financial support from the Voluntary Trust Fund (VTF).

467,,2020-02-02 13:09:38,4.0,"This is a photograph from the 6th annual running of the Trim AC 10 Mile Road Race and Fun Run which was held in Trim, Co. Meath, Ireland on Sunday 2nd February 2020 at 12:00. The race attracted over 1,500 finishers which demonstrates again the popularity of this race. Indeed the event shows growth year on year mirroring the growing popularity of the race. The race started on the Trim/Athboy road on the town's ring road and proceeds to take an anti-clockwise loop out towards the village of Dunderry and townland of Kilbride before returning back to the Trim Industrial Estate for the finish. The route is held on quiet country roads with some hills at 3, 6, 8 mile segments. The road is well marked and marshaled and is comfortable able to accommodate the race at its current size.

The weather for this year's race good but there was a significant breezy headwind from around the half way mark until the the finish. Many runners found this particularly difficult.
This photographs is part of a large Flickr photoset of photographs of photographs from the 1 mile mark, 2 mile mark and also from the 500 and 100 meters to go mark. The full Flickr photoset is available at <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157712944593478"">www.flickr.com/photos/peterm7/albums/72157712944593478</a>

Waterstops were provided at the 4.5 and 7 mile marks on the course. All access roads were well stewarded. Indeed the majority of the race was run on closed roads. The event was sponsored by Nally's SuperValu, who are based in the heart of Trim, and many other local business establishments. Credit must go to the Trim AC team for their flawless organisation. If the first three years of this year are anything to go on then this race will continue to grow in popularity. Runners from clubs and groups in almost every county in Ireland were represented today. For runners around the North Leinster and Midlands area this 10 mile race serves as a perfect training progress stepping stone to the Bohermeen Half Marathon which will take place in March 2020 and is located only 15 minutes drive from Trim. Again this year, today's race also served as the Meath AAI 10 Mile Road Race Championships.

The 10 Mile Road Race is becoming somewhat an endangered species of the Irish road racing calendar. The popularity of shorter races and in some cases the half marathon sees less 10 mile races being organised. There is also the considerable road management associated with the 10 mile distance. However, today's race in Trim shows that there is still huge appeal in these races. As the Ballycotton 10 Mile slogan used to be &quot;A classic race ... at a classic distance&quot;. The Trim 10 Mile is slowing becoming the Ballycotton of North Leinster with the club's offering of this classic distance.

Timing and overall event management was provided by the Co. Kildare based company Popup Races. The results and more details about the race will be found on their website at <a href=""https://www.popupraces.ie"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.popupraces.ie</a>

Yèvre-le-Châtel


L'église Saint-Lubin (Gothique, premier quart du XIIIe siècle).  Chapiteaux.

Edifice dédié à saint Lubin évêque de Chartres.

La nef unique de deux travées est coupée par un transept dont les croisillons ne comprennent chacun qu'une travée, elle se termine par un chevet plat caractéristique du 13è siècle.


Au XIIIe siècle, compte tenu notamment de l'accroissement de la population, les habitants de Yèvre-le-Châtel obtinrent de l'évêque d'Orléans la construction d'une seconde église paroissiale dans le cimetière. Mais à la suite de l'opposition des moines de Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire, les travaux furent interrompus. Ils reprirent après la guerre de Cent Ans mais ne furent jamais menés à terme. En 1708, l'évêque autorisa la récupération des pierres  tombées. Saint-Lubin fut donc ruinée sans être achevée.

Les vestiges romantiques de cette église firent l’admiration de Victor Hugo. Le 21 août 1834, Victor Hugo est à Yèvre avec Juliette Drouet. Hugo, dans une lettre à son épouse Adèle, évoque Yèvre-le-Châtel : &quot;J'ai passé hier une admirable journée à Pithiviers et aux environs. Yèvre-le-Châtel est à deux lieues, et où je suis allé à pied avec mes souliers percé, contient à lui seul un couvent et un château, ruinés, mais complets. C'est magnifique. Je dessine tout ce que je vois.&quot;.

A mineral is a naturally-occurring, solid, inorganic, crystalline substance having a fairly definite chemical composition and having fairly definite physical properties.  At its simplest, a mineral is a naturally-occurring solid chemical.  Currently, there are over 5500 named and described minerals - about 200 of them are common and about 20 of them are very common.  Mineral classification is based on anion chemistry.  Major categories of minerals are: elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, and silicates.

The halides are the &quot;salt minerals&quot;, and have one or more of the following anions: Cl-, F-, I-, Br-.

Halite is true salt, which consists of sodium chloride (NaCl).  This is the same chemical long used as flavoring on food &amp; as a preservative.  It has a nonmetallic luster, typically clearish/coloress, and is relatively soft (H = 2.5).  Halite forms cubic crystals and has cubic cleavage (= 3 cleavage planes meeting at 90º angles).  Halite is most readily identified by its strongly salty taste.

Halite has economic value.  In addition to its use in food, salt is traditionally used in large quantities in wintertime to prevent roadways from icing up.  Halite is principally mined from ancient rock salt successions.  Rock salt is a chemical sedimentary rock composed of halite and formed by evaporation of seawater.

Seen here is a small cluster of pink halite from Searles Lake in California.  Through geologic time, the lake has alternated between having water and being dry.  What little water does occur in modern Searles Lake is highly saline.  When the water evaporates, halite precipitates.  The pinkish coloration is from incorporation of pigments (carotenoids) in halophilic archaea and algae that live in the water.

Locality: Searles Lake, next to the town of Trona, far-northwestern San Bernardino County, southern California, USA

Único item da pauta, o PLN 2/2020 altera a Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias (LDO) para inserir critérios que podem barrar a execução obrigatória de emendas parlamentares individuais ou de bancada.

Essa é a primeira sessão virtual do Congresso Nacional na história. É realizada na sala da Secretaria de Tecnologia da Informação (Prodasen) e conduzida pelo primeiro vice-presidente da Câmara dos Deputados. Como os sistemas de deliberação remota (SDR) do Senado Federal e da Câmara dos Deputados não estão integrados, a sessão do Congresso é realizada separadamente pelas duas casas.

970,"Hollywood, CA, USA",2019-11-29 13:50:31,4.0,"The Valley of the Gods is a scenic sandstone valley near Mexican Hat in San Juan County, southeastern Utah, United States. Formerly part of Bears Ears National Monument, Valley of the Gods is located north of Monument Valley across the San Juan River and has rock formations similar to those in Monument Valley with tall, reddish brown mesas, buttes, towers and mushroom rocks—remnants of an ancient landscape.

The Valley of the Gods may be toured via a 17-mile (27 km) gravel road (San Juan County Road 242) that winds around the formations. The road is rather steep and bumpy in parts but is passable by non-four-wheel drive vehicles in dry weather. The western end joins Utah State Route 261 shortly before its 1,200-foot (370 m) ascent up Cedar Mesa at Moki Dugway, while the eastern end starts nine miles (14 km) from the town of Mexican Hat along U.S. Route 163 and heads north, initially crossing flat, open land and following the course of Lime Creek, a seasonal wash, before turning west toward the buttes and pinnacles. In addition to the gravel road, the area is also crisscrossed by off-road dirt trails.

The valley has been used as the backdrop for western movies, commercials and television shows including two episodes of the BBC science fiction show Doctor Who: &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot; and &quot;Day of the Moon&quot;, the second of which includes an explicit on-screen reference to the filming location.  The 1984-1987 CBS TV show Airwolf is often mistakenly identified as being filmed in Valley of the Gods due to an in-episode mention but was filmed in Monument Valley

The breccia formed in the subsurface during a caldera-forming event that followed a large explosive volcanic eruption (see Braun, 2016).  The granite pluton itself is the remains of the cooled magma chamber beneath that ancient volcanic center.

“The Mystery Oil Pits”

The Mystery Oil Pits are shallow depressions in the landscape located at the end of the Drake Well Museum grounds near Oil Creek State Park.  Native Americans used petroleum as medicine and taught the European settlers how to collect it for use as salves.

Research conducted by Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute and funded by The Colonel, Incorporated, dated Native American use of oil seeps on the museum grounds to approximately 1410-1440 A.D.  Carbon dating techniques used in combination with annular tree-ring data were applied to pieces of wooden cribbing excavataed during an archaeological dig by Sue Ann Curtis in the 1970s.

Locality: grounds of the Drake Well Museum, southeast of the town of Titusville, northern Venango County, northwestern Pennsylvania, USA

I have to tell you that I’m no longer updating my photostream at a regular rate. My last upload was some months ago and since then I even haven’t had time to thank you for your comments and faves. It was a pretty busy year for me and next year will be not any different. Over the last years, you’ve made my stream a real success by loads of faves and comments and invitations to groups and I’m very grateful for that. However, there came a time when coping with these social media activities put more and more a strain on me and I had to make a decision, i.e. whether I should either neglect my professional and private life or my flickr stream. On the other hand, I didn’t cease to take pictures (NEVER – just scrap it, dude) and actually, I like to show them to other people.
So I’m now trying to establish such a thing as an, mhm, unsocial media agreement with you, and it goes like this: If you like one of my pics – thanx a lot, but don’t fave it and don’t comment on it. If you do it nevertheless, please don’t expect an answer or an reciprocal fave, because it might take months before I check my stream the next time and by then, my activities list will show nilch.
I wish you the very best, and may the gods of light and art be with you!
Picturepest, a.k.a. Michael

—The first lens exclusively for digital SLRs—

AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED
Tale 68 discusses the dawn of the digital SLR camera. That dawn broke on the AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED, the first lens for use exclusively with digital SLRs. What were the circumstances that led to the release of this lens around the same time the D2H was released in 2003?

by Kouichi Ohshita

The dawn of the digital SLR

The first digital SLRs sold to the public were probably introduced with Kodak's DSC series in the 1990s. Kodak achieved these cameras by equipping Nikon camera bodies with large proprietary sensors and circuit boards. As they were very expensive, and systems and environments for handling digital images were still being developed, their use was rather limited to specialized applications.

Construction of systems that could handle digital images began in the late 1990s as the popularity of Macintosh and Windows spread and digital printing technologies advanced. This helped to make digital cameras more common. In 1995, Nikon worked with Fuji Photo Film to develop the E2 and E2s digital SLR cameras, which were based on the F4. These innovative cameras differed from Kodak's DSC-series cameras in that they were equipped with a compact, 2/3-inch, 1.3-MP sensor, and achieved images with the same angle of view as those captured on 35mm film through reduction projection (reduction optics system/ROS) of the F mount NIKKOR image. Despite the high prices of these cameras with the base model E2 at ¥1,100,000, they came to be regularly used, primarily by newspapers and other press photographers.

However, while the E2 was popular for its angle of view, which was equivalent to that of the 35mm format, it did have its drawbacks. The biggest issue with the camera was that its reduction optics system (ROS) blocked a portion of the light passing through the lens. The E2 specifications state an aperture range of f/6.7-38. This means that because the amount of light passing through the lens is restricted by the ROS, the characteristics of fast (bright) lenses, such as f/1.4 lenses, cannot be achieved with the camera. In fact, the aperture had to be stopped down to f/6.7 or a larger f-number to use such lenses with the camera. This makes it very difficult to make the most of lens characteristics. In addition, the ROS was poorly matched with some lenses, and completely blocked light around the edge of the frame for severe vignetting. As a result, there were some NIKKOR lenses that simply could not be used effectively with the camera.

II. Top 01 project

Another digital camera trend arose in the second half of the 1990s. That trend was in compact digital cameras, and its best representative was the Casio QV-10. The QV-10 was one of the first consumer digital cameras to have an LCD monitor on the back, which allowed users to view images as soon as they were captured. The camera gradually grew in popularity because its images could be transferred to the personal computers that were becoming more and more common, its operation was relatively simple, and at a price of around ¥100,000, which wasn't completely out of the range of possibility for many consumers.


In June of 1996, shortly after the QV-10 was released, Nikon initiated a new development project in June of 1996. The objective of that project, carried out by a 14-member project team led by Mr. Naoki Tomino and of which I was a member, was to develop a full-scale digital camera. Predicting that the digital camera market would one day be just as large as the film camera market, Tomino had lobbied upper management for permission and resources to launch such a project. The project team, based in a small room on the third floor of the Ohi 101 Building between the north and center wings, and comprised of members knowledgeable in and experienced with various fields, including electrical engineering, mechanics, imaging, and optics, argued and discussed all aspects from their own differing positions until an outline for the ideal digital camera was achieved. For me, knowledgeable only in optical design, work with this team was very stimulating, and presented a great opportunity to expand my knowledge beyond optics.

While the primary objective of this project team, established under these circumstances, was the development of a compact digital camera that offered excellent image quality, we proceeded with considerations for digital SLR cameras in mind. Tomino, the team leader, and the entire team really wanted to revolutionize the imaging world by creating a full-scale digital SLR camera that could be sold at a price that encouraged purchase by professional and amateur photographers themselves. As our investigations and work progressed, Tomino presented upper management with the following proposal. &quot;Let this project be like a two-stage rocket with development of a compact digital camera offering excellent image quality as the first stage, and development of a full-scale digital SLR as the second stage.&quot; His proposal was approved, and our work toward a digital SLR camera continued, and we successfully introduced the Nikon D1 digital SLR camera in 1999 just one year after completing the first stage of the project with the release of the COOLPIX 900.

Nikon D1

III. The AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED

The D1 was an overwhelming hit, primarily with photojournalists, because it offered the same operation, strength, and durability as the F5, with which they were already familiar, and because its price was extraordinary for a digital SLR. It was the major trend setter for digital SLRs. However, there was one problem with the D1. Because the image sensor built into the camera was smaller than 35mm film, lens angle of view was narrowed. The lens mounted on the D1 in the photo above is the (AI) AF-S Zoom-Nikkor 17-35mm f/2.8D IF-ED, which was released at about the same time as the D1. However, when this lens was used with the D1, the range of supported focal lengths shifted to 25.5-55mm, just the standard range for a normal zoom lens. While this narrowing of the angle of view has its advantages, including being convenient for telephoto photography and the excellent image quality that is achieved because only the center portion of the image circle is used, it cannot be denied that it was a disadvantage for wide-angle lenses. Therefore, from the time the D1 was released, Tomino and I hoped that, if the D1 proved to be a success, we would like to make a NIKKOR lens for use exclusively with digital SLR cameras.
That dream was put in motion in the spring of 2001 just before D1 successor models, the D1X and D1H, were released. D1 sales gradually increased, and it was a time when Nikon was planning to further cement its status in the market by releasing successor models. Planning for the next model after the D1X, the D2H, had already begun, and we planned to release a dedicated lens at the same time the D2H was to be released. The concept behind the lens was to achieve ultra-wide angles and a compact size not possible with lenses that could also be used with 35mm format cameras, as well as superior optical performance compatible with digital cameras. The person placed in charge of designing such a lens was Mr. Haruo Sato.

At the time, Sato was developing another normal zoom lens, and it wasn't the best time to work on another lens until its development is completed. Therefore, Sato came up with the design, and another designer succeeded him, creating drawings based on his design, and saw development of the lens through to the end. As this was the first lens for use exclusively with digital cameras, development began by deciding upon design objectives. While I'm sure there was some fumbling along the way, the design was completed in a surprisingly short time. Perhaps the fact that it was such a busy time for Sato with multiple designs in the works all at once led to a variety of ideas and the ability to complete the design so quickly.

IV. Lens construction

Figure 1. AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED cross section

Figure 1 shows how this lens is constructed. It is a zoom lens with a two-group zoom structure for which the negative-lead structure suitable for wide-angle lenses was adopted, and with which the first group is made up of four elements and the second seven elements.

Another suitable structure would have been the concave-convex-concave-convex four-group structure, and while four-group zoom lenses naturally offer greater freedom to increase performance, it is likely that Sato went with the two-group structure because of a zoom ratio of 2x, which is rather small, and a speed (brightness) of f/4, which is not extremely bright.

The characteristics of this lens lie with the structure of each lens group. Let's start with the first group. The diameter of the first lens element exceeds 50mm and both surfaces are aspherical. The aspherical element having concave surfaces on both sides is separated by a single convex element. A single aspherical surface would be sufficient if the only goal is to correct distortion. However, that does not compensate for sagittal coma flare, which would be increased by curvature of field remaining at the edges of the frame. By utilizing two aspherical elements with this lens, however, distortion, curvature of field, and coma could be suitably controlled. The field was flattened (curvature of field corrected) and sagittal coma flare reduced, all while correcting barrel distortion for pleasing results. This way of designing lenses with a negative lead zoom structure using two aspherical lens elements in the first group has since been used in designing a number of wide-angle zoom lenses.

Another characteristic of this lens lies in the structure of the second group. I want you all to remember some previous tales from NIKKOR The Thousand and One Nights. Tales 46 and 63, for example, cover NIKKOR lenses for which two-group zoom structures were adopted. I'd like you to compare the second-group structures of the lenses discussed in those tales with the one discussed here. As Sato indicated in Tale 63, the convex-convex-concave-convex Ernostar structure is likely the standard for the second group in two-group zoom structures. However, if you look at Figure 1, you won't see that structure. There is no concave lens element. The secret here is that the concave element has been separated into two elements, which were then attached to the front and back of a convex element. The Ernostar structure increases flexibility in correcting aberrations, but it comes with difficulties in that it is very sensitive to spacing between lens elements, as well as center thickness and decentering. I think that Sato chose this type that would have no strong convergence or divergence caused by a convex lens element and a concave element to eliminate these issues. Using an aspherical lens for the last element effectively compensates for aspherical and coma aberrations.


V. Lens rendering

As always, let's take a look at this lens' rendering characteristics with sample images. I used the lens with the compact, 24-MP D3300 to capture these sample images, taking it with me on walks and trips. Though the D3300 offers a pixel count that couldn't even be imagined at the time this lens was developed, because of the fact that it was developed with the expectation that pixel counts would increase, I was able to capture the images I hoped for. However, when used with a compact camera like the D3300, balance isn't as good as it would be with a somewhat larger and heavier camera like the D500 or D7500.

Sample 1 is a photo of the Milky Way captured in the summer at the 12mm maximum wide-angle position and maximum aperture. Unfortunately, light clouds at the bottom and upper right of the frame prevented sharp and clear capture of the stars. For me, the most appealing aspect of this lens is the abundance of peripheral illumination throughout the entire zoom range. With most lenses, the amount of peripheral illumination drops as the focal length decreases. With this lens, however, there is an abundance of peripheral illumination throughout the entire zoom range, and there is no noticeable lack of light volume from maximum aperture. As you can see from the mountain in the bottom left corner of this sample image, contrast was greatly enhanced to bring out the stars and Milky Way. Despite this, however, note that there is no noticeable drop in the amount of peripheral illumination. Another important feature is the lack of sagittal coma flare. Sagittal coma flare is a type of aberration that tends to become more noticeable as the angle of view increases, but it is hardly noticeable in this image. If we look very closely, we can see that stars at the edges of the frame are slightly distorted, but I think that this is quite a good starscape for having been captured by an ultra wide-angle lens at maximum aperture.

Sample 2 is a photo of a field of spider lilies captured at the maximum wide-angle position. I stopped the aperture down to f/11 for deep focus, but the foreground and farther end are still a little blurred. Even distortion has been well compensated for an ultra wide-angle zoom lens. However, some barrel distortion may be noticeable in the corners of the frame when photographing subjects at close distances at the maximum wide-angle position. Should that occur, I recommend using the camera's or Capture NX-D's auto distortion control function.

Sample 3 is a photo of the sunset from Kōzu-shima (Kōzu Island). This photo was also captured at the 12mm maximum wide-angle position and maximum aperture. You can see the moon just past the new crescent stage at upper left in the photo. Anyone who sees a landscape as stunning as this on vacation will be glad to have brought along an ultra wide-angle lens. It is easy to get an idea of the angle of view captured with lenses with an 18mm focal length (with conversion to 35mm format) because the horizontal angle of view is approximately 90 degrees.

I zoomed in a little, and captured Sample 4 at the 14mm focal length. It is a photo of Senryo Pond, a cove on the south side of Kōzu-shima. By stopping down the aperture to f/8, I achieved consistent rendering all the way to the extreme edges of the frame.

Sample 5 is a photo of a cape in the southwest of Kōzu-shima. I zoomed in about half way to capture this photo at 17mm. The ability to shoot at the ultra wide-angle 12mm, and also to zoom in to 24mm is very convenient when traveling. I think a person could capture a great many scenes with this lens and a fast 50mm prime lens.
Sample 6 is a photo of the field of spider lilies captured at the 24mm maximum telephoto position. I stopped the aperture down to f/11 for a deep depth of field. If we compare this image to Sample 2, which was captured at the maximum wide-angle position, we see that even photos of the same subject can look and feel very different.

D3300 + AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED at 24mm, f/11, 1/60 s, ISO 1100 Processed with Capture NX-D
Sample 7 is a photo of an agapanthus that I captured at a park. I zoomed in to 15mm and shot this photo at maximum aperture. If we look at the background blur (bokeh), we see consistent ring-shaped blur throughout the frame, and double-line blur along the tree trunks and branches. I suppose that you could say that these blur characteristics are a shortcoming of this lens. However, it could also be said that the consistency of the ring-shaped blur is proof of the abundance of peripheral illumination and lack of vignetting.

Sample 8 is a photo of the field of spider lilies captured at the 24mm maximum telephoto position to show blur characteristics. With this lens, double-line blur is most noticeable at mid-range focal lengths. It seems that the tendency toward double-line blur is mitigated at both 12mm and 24mm. By stopping down the aperture one stop for this image, ring-shaped blur was eliminated. This in turn makes double-line blur less noticeable. When shooting in a way that utilizes bokeh, I recommend stopping down the aperture just a little as I have done here. Some are hesitant to stop down the aperture when using a wide-angle lens so that they may make use of bokeh because doing so actually reduces the amount of bokeh. However, rings are formed as light is condensed, so stopping down the aperture just one stop shouldn't result in a noticeable reduction in the amount of bokeh.

Sample 7

D3300 + AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm f/4G IF-ED at 24mm, f/5.6, 1/60 s, ISO 200 Processed with Capture NX-D

This lens, released at about the same time as the D2H in 2003, was well received by users of the D1, D100, and D2 who were missing out on wide-angle photography, and sales of this long seller continue even today. That is probably because as the first lens for use exclusively with digital SLR cameras it was designed with such thought and care. For example, this lens was designed so that its image circle is just a little larger than that of current DX lenses. That was done because at the time this lens was developed, the designers thought that it was possible that digital SLR frame size would increase in the future. Setting such high objectives resulted in outstandingly abundant peripheral illumination and sharp and clear images at ultra-wide angles. This lens clearly offers unique characteristics just not found with others, don't you think?

Description

Ethernet Line Service

E-Line / Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)

Point-to-Point

Two customer premise equipment (CPE) devices can exchange. Ethernet frames, similar in concept to a leased line.

Ethernet LAN Service

E-LAN / Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

Full mesh

Acts like a LAN, in that all devices can send frames to all other devices. (N(N-1)/2)

Ethernet Tree Service

E-Tree

Hub-and-spoke: partial mesh: point-to-multipoint

A central site can communicate to a defined set of remote sites, but the remote sites cannot communicate directly.

Route redistribution – taking routes from one routing protocol process and injecting them into another.

MPLS does this between PE router using variation of Multiprotocol BGP (MPBGP)

EIGRP in MPLS

A CE router does become neighbors with the PE router on the othe end of the access link.

A CE router does not become neighbors with toher CE routers.

The MPLS network will advertise the customer’s routes between the various PE routers, so that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing protocol neighbor relationship.

OSPF

The MPLS Pes form a backbone area by the name of a super backbone..

Each PE-CE link can be any area, a non-backbone area or the backnone area.

Senado vota a PEC 26/2020, proposta de emenda à Constituição que torna permanente o Fundo de Manutenção e Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica e de Valorização dos Profissionais da Educação (Fundeb). O fundo atual será extinto em 31 de dezembro e se não for renovado, fica ameaçada a distribuição de recursos para o financiamento educacional no país. Além de tornar o Fundeb uma política permanente de Estado, a proposta aumenta progressivamente o percentual de participação da União nos recursos do fundo de 10% para 23%, até 2026.

1401,"Portland, America",2019-10-25 11:05:24,4.0,"View of the Elk Creek Wild and Scenic River on an autumn morning, Oct. 25, 2019, by Greg Shine, BLM.

Designated as a part of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019, Elk Creek is a 7.3-mile long scenic river. Elk Creek and the land surrounding are currently under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, though the Dingell Act placed the administration of the wild and scenic river under the Bureau of Land Management. The creek meanders through a broad valley edged by sloping foothills. The designated segment includes the site of the now decommissioned and notched Elk Creek Dam.

A trail, which is paved for much of its length, runs along Elk Creek and can be accessed from trailheads at the downstream and upstream end of the trail. Visitors to the area can enjoy the scenic beauty of the creek while hiking, biking, or horseback riding along the trail through a mix of grassland, riparian hardwoods, and conifers.

Know Before You Go:

•Access roads to Elk Creek are gated and open to the public only between May 1 and November 15.
•Use caution when exploring along the creek.
•Vault toilets are located at both trailheads.
•Be aware of and respect private property in the area.
•No overnight camping is allowed in the area and motorized vehicles are not permitted beyond the trailheads.
•The incomplete dam structure and construction site are not authorized for public access and may include hazardous materials.

Location:

Elk Creek is about a 45-minute drive north of Medford, Oregon.  Travel north on OR-62 for approximately 20 miles and then take a left on Elk Creek Road to reach both trailheads.

Weather was fine, air was filled with smoke from all of the California fires all around us.  You couldn't see the mountains that are normally all around San Bernardino.   Just this light grey haze.

This yard is very friendly to people who are there to take photos.  I talked to security a few times over the course of like 5 hours.  Obviously you aren't going to be allowed down on the tracks, but photos and video were fine.  Just check YouTube for all of the other people's videos from here.

The platform is so close to the actual tracks I had issues.    I had to back up far enough, almost on to the incoming MetroLink rails to even be able to get 45 deg. shot of the freight cars.  Normally, if you've seen my work I like to show whole cars.   I'll have to invest in a wider lens if I'm going to continue travelling out to the Santa Fe Depot for freight graffiti.

Met Pasadena Sub Colin out there and he was actually filming.  I only shoot photos, but if you want to see some great video check out his channel, and subscribe.  He's all over SoCal filming trains.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ALSPWMjJdBDdnVD0inmgQ"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ALSPWMjJdBDdnVD0inmgQ</a>

The tower still exists on site, and is dominant in the landscape, but is in a ruinous state and access is closed. In addition to the signal tower, a later semaphore station sits close by, as does a Look Out Post (LOP) constructed in 1939 during the final period of occupation and operation of this site. As a final gem on this site, a large stone EIRE sign, along with the number 80 sits on the headland, a sign to indicate to aircraft making landfall that they are entering the neutral territory of Ireland.

Kamisaka Sekka (1866–1942) was one of the most prominent artists in twentieth-century Japan. Although he was born in a Samurai family, he eventually chose to become an artist. During his trip to Glasgow World's Exposition in 1910, he was exposed to Art Nouveau, which later influenced his works. Upon returning to Japan, he started to blend Western art with traditional Japanese art by applying western styles and methods to Japanese subject matter. With this newfound style and his active cooperation with other artisans to integrate his works into ceramics and textiles, Kamisaka became one of the pioneers of modern design in Japan. We have digitally enhanced some of his notable works and made them available for you to download and enjoy under the creative commons 0 licenses.

1614,,2020-10-16 15:26:10,4.0,"Thanks to all the writers!

After a disastrous last weekend trying to bench this spot and being chased away by like 800 bikers,  I went back this weekend and managed to be out here for a little over 5 hours without issue. 11:30 AM - 5 PM.

Not to say that there wasn't some sketchiness going on, but when you're out for hours your bound to see some shit going down.  It's usually just homeless shenanigans, but I leave them alone and they leave me alone.  Everyone just kinda' gets along and minds their own business. Just how I like it.

Spotted some AMAZING pieces today. Some of my favorite writers doing their best work, and not so best work, but seeing their work makes going out there worth it to me.

The added benefit:  I got out of the house for a few hours, didn't think about work, life, the f-ing Covid, or anything else besides spotting some great pieces and getting the best shots of those pieces I could.  Good times.

700+ shots this session, culled down to a little under 600.  A lot of shots, yeah.  But, every time I take a shot I'm documenting something that might get buffed next week and it will be gone forever.  Documenting art that could vanish in a week, a month, a year.. Who knows.  Either way, I've captured it, and will share it for as long as I can.

All in all, it was a good day.","['Graffiti', 'Art', 'Paint', 'Spraypaint', 'Graff', 'Bombing', 'Rail Fan', 'Train', 'Freight', 'Autorack', 'Boxcar', 'Tracks', 'Flick', 'Tag', 'Piece', 'Traincar', 'Well Car', 'Benching', 'Railcar', 'Hopper', 'Freights', 'Railroad', 'Rails', 'Krylon', 'Montana', 'MTN', '94', 'Flicks', 'Rust-Oleum', 'Southern California', 'California', 'SoCal', 'CC Attribution License', 'Creative Commons', '(CC) License', 'Fujifilm X-Pro3', 'Fujifilm 23mm f/2', 'YEAH']",181.0,0.0

1671,,2020-11-02 14:54:11,4.0,"Long write-up for today's batch of awesomeness.

First off.  This whole covid thing, the election, working from home, not being able to go out, not seeing friends/family, etc. Has me, and I'm sure everyone else frazzled.   Having a project to work on, in my case hiking out and shooting photos of graffiti on trains has been the one thing that's keeping me sane at this point.   Hoping to see some new pieces from writers that I respect is like opening a pack of baseball cards and finding your favorite players rookie card for me.   Yeah, it sounds goofy, but I've been having fun, staying sane, and seeing and capturing some amazing pieces of rolling art.

So I had this weird Monday vacation day on 11-2-2020.   I decided to drive out to one my my benching spots and hang out for the day.

The plan was to set up a time lapse camera, and then just hang out and bench freights for 5-6 hours.   There wasn't a cloud in the sky and a slight breeze, 88F. high.   No clouds makes for a very boring time lapse between trains coming by. I also only brought my little Small Rig clamp for the time lapse camera and couldn't decide where I wanted to clamp it.   I should have just brought a tripod.

Out for a few hours before the BNSF guys in their truck rolled up,  got out and started walking toward me.  &quot;Great!&quot; I thought.  They're going to try and chase me away.  Nope, they walked over to one set of tracks, walked across the bridge inspecting the tracks, then under the bridge inspecting the bridge, got in their truck and left.   I like that.  I don't bother you. You don't bother me.
A while later I see tree guy coming back home.   I don't know his name, but there's a guy who lives in/under a tree that's next to the trail I hike in on.  Once he's in there you'd never know it.  I've seen him, he's seen me, and we don't bother each other.

The whole time I'm there I'm using my little Tascam recorder to record train audio every time one comes by so I have audio for the slideshow videos I've been uploading on YouTube.  Well,  this time I forgot it out there.  Didn't dump my photos until Tuesday night and discovered it missing.   Woke up early, drove out and it was still there.   It recorded for almost 5 more hours before the batteries died.  Glad to have it back, I thought tree guy might have found it.

My normal lens for freights is the Fujifilm 23mm f/2, but being so close to the tracks at the depot I mostly used the 7Artisans 7.5mm f/2.8.  It's hard to use anything else that close and capture the pieces straight on.  Most of these shots I'm between 10-25 or so feet away from the train.  Much closer than I normally shoot when I'm out on a hike.   Still getting used to shooting this close.  The cars roll by much faster when your this close!

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_367-80"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_367-80</a>

The Boeing 367-80, known simply as the Dash 80, is an American quadjet prototype aircraft built by Boeing to demonstrate the advantages of jet propulsion for commercial aviation. It served as basis for the design of the KC-135 tanker and the 707 airliner.

The Dash 80 first flew in 1954, less than two years from project launch. Its US$16 million cost (equivalent to $154 million today) was an enormous risk for Boeing, which at the time had no committed customers. Only one example was built, which has been preserved and is currently on public display at the Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia.

By the late 1940s two developments encouraged Boeing to begin considering building a passenger jet. The first was the maiden flight in 1947 of the B-47 Stratojet. The second was the maiden flight in 1949 of the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet. Boeing President Bill Allen led a company delegation to the UK in summer 1950, where they saw the Comet fly at the Farnborough Airshow, and also visited the de Havilland factory at Hatfield, Hertfordshire where the Comets were being built. Boeing felt it had mastered the swept wing and podded engines which it saw as key technologies that would enable it to improve on the Comet.


In 1950 Boeing tentatively produced a specification for a jet airliner dubbed the Model 473-60C. The airlines were unconvinced because they had no experience with jet transports and were enjoying success with piston engined aircraft such as the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, Boeing Stratocruiser and Lockheed Constellation.

Boeing was experienced at selling to the military but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at meeting the needs of airlines by refining and developing its range of propeller-driven aircraft, and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – and of itself – was to show them a completed aircraft.

After 2,350 hours and 1,691 flights the aircraft was withdrawn from use in 1969 and placed in storage. On May 26, 1972 Boeing donated the 367-80 to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, which had designated it one of the 12 most significant aircraft of all time. For the next 18 years the aircraft was stored at a &quot;desert boneyard&quot; now called the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona before being retrieved by Boeing in 1990 for restoration. The Dash 80's final flight was to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. on August 27, 2003. Repainted to its original yellow and brown Boeing livery, it was put on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, located adjacent to Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.

Out for the day to see some trains and some amazing art roll by.  All of the &quot;Fisheye&quot; 7.5mm shots the time is off by one hour, as I forgot to change the clock on the Fujifilm X-E-3 when we &quot;Fell&quot; back.

Arrived about 10:15AM,  pulled up to the trailhead parking lot, into the first space next to the handicaped parking space and immediately noticed that there was a cargo type van, pulled off of the blacktop, and there were a couple guys with cameras filming into the back of the van.  Hmmm...  When I got out of the car I noticed that there was a guy in the back of the van, tied up, and had tape accross his mouth.  I figured they were filming some sort of project and asked if I should move my car as I was only one space away from where they were filming.  No, you're fine.  Ok,  and a hiking I would go.  Out to my favorite benching spot.  My favorite place to go to graffiti, and have graffiti delivered to me via the rails and locally.

It doesn't take long to get to my spot,  but the spot is magical.  Weird rocks, desert, not to hard to get to, and trains all day...

I go out there by myself, but see tons of people rolling through on their quads, jeeps, and $20k side by sides with flags and music blaring out into the desert.  Always some crappy music.  Nothing that makes me feel like I'm out in the desert alone.  The Jim Morrison vibes when you're out there alone are real.  It can be scary, friendly, hot or cold.   The desert can be inviting one minute, but when you're running low on water harsh in the next.  I've been to the beach maybe a handfull of times in my life, but have been to the desert hundreds, and it's my comfort spot.

Saw a ton of amazing pieces today and captured most of them.  Had fun, and didn't get bitten by anything.  All in all,  it was a great way to spend the day.

Turns out the people filming the guy tied up in the van were filming part of a music video.  Had a nice 5 min. conversation with them and home I went to look at the treasures I'd captured.

Stay safe out there !!!!

Bivalves are bilaterally symmetrical molluscs having two calcareous, asymmetrical shells (valves) - they include the clams, oysters, and scallops.  In most bivalves, the two shells are mirror images of each other (the major exception is the oysters).  They occur in marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments.  Bivalves are also known as pelecypods and lamellibranchiates.

Bivalves are sessile, benthic organisms - they occur on or below substrates.  Most of them are filter-feeders, using siphons to bring in water, filter the water for tiny particles of food, then expel the used water.  The majority of bivalves are infaunal - they burrow into unlithified sediments.  In hard substrate environments, some forms make borings, in which the bivalve lives.  Some groups are hard substrate encrusters, using a mineral cement to attach to rocks, shells, or wood.

The fossil record of bivalves is Cambrian to Recent.  They are especially common in the post-Paleozoic fossil record.

Scallops are common marine bivalves in much of the fossil record and in the modern oceans.  Individual bivalve shells, unlike brachiopod shells, are asymmetrical.  Scallop shells sometimes approach bilateral symmetry, but the subtriangular, wing-like auricles along the hingeline will still display asymmetry.  One of the auricles has a basal notch.  A notched auricle on the right side of a shell indicates a right valve.  A notched auricle on the left side of a shell indicates a left valve.  If the auricles are partially broken or eroded, the preserved growth lines will indicate which side had the notch.

-------------------------------
Mt. Etna is a regularly-erupting volcano along the eastern margin of Sicily, a large Mediterranean island offshore from southern Italy.  Generally, Etna's eruptions are strombolian in style and spectacularly gorgeous, especially when viewed at night (e.g., <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/fabriziozuccarello/50953312297/in/photostream/lightbox/"">www.flickr.com/photos/fabriziozuccarello/50953312297/in/p...</a> ).  Etna is also famous for blowing smoke rings (e.g., <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/volcanoes/10842987365/in/photostream/lightbox/"">www.flickr.com/photos/volcanoes/10842987365/in/photostrea...</a> ).

Much of Etna's erupted material is trachybasalt.  Trachybasalt has the same general physical, chemical, and mineralogical characteristics as basalt, but is more alkaline (= relatively high Na and K content).

The angular lapillus specimen seen here is from an airfall deposit that originated from a 16 February 2021 strombolian eruption of Mt. Etna.  The rock is composed of frothy glass.  Anchored threads of glass (&quot;Pele's hair&quot;) are present in some vesicles.

This monster, appropriately called a red hypergiant, is as bright as 300,000 Suns. Yet it is so far away that, 200 years ago, it could be seen only as a faint star in the winter constellation of the Great Dog. Since then, it has faded and is no longer visible to the naked eye. Astronomers used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to get a close-up look at the star and discovered the reason for the dimming. The star is expelling huge clouds of dust in the final stages of its life. Eventually, the bloated star may explode as a supernova, or may simply collapse and form a black hole.

This zoom into VY Canis Majoris is a combination of Hubble imaging and an artist's impression. The left panel is a multicolor Hubble image of the huge nebula of material cast off by the hypergiant star. This nebula is approximately 300 billion kilometres across.

The middle panel is a close-up Hubble view of the region around the star. This image reveals close-in knots, arcs, and filaments of material ejected from the star as it goes through its violent process of casting off material into space. VY Canis Majoris is not seen in this view, but the tiny red square marks the location of the hypergiant, and represents the diameter of the solar system out to the orbit of Neptune, which is 5.5 billion miles across.

The final panel is an artist's impression of the hypergiant star with vast convection cells and undergoing violent ejections. VY Canis Majoris is so large that if it replaced the Sun, the star would extend for hundreds of millions of miles, to between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.

In addition to the forced labor of Xinjiang cotton in the Xinjiang concentration camps, there is also the more evil &quot;forced organ harvesting&quot; going on behind the scenes.

It would be great if there were superheroes in this world.

※Just speak up for them, you are their superhero!

新疆集中營內除了強迫勞動的「新疆棉」，背後還隱藏著更為邪惡的「活摘器官」。

如果這個世界有超級英雄就好了。

Texto:
A moda dos anos 60
A fotografia revela a jovem Maria Isabel Tranchete. Contava com 14 anos quando posou para o fotógrafo, nos jardins da casa dos seus pais. Através desta fotografia conseguimos tirar várias ilações: a jovem Isabel revela serenidade face à lente fotográfica que mostra um momento, uma roupa e um dia da sua adolescência. Neste momento Isabel revela um ligeiro sorriso para ser captado pela lente; o seu cabelo é curto, chegando à zona dos ombros, é escuro e apresenta uma risca ao lado e a franja, que se prende atrás da orelha. A roupa, aparentemente simples, é reveladora da moda que se vivia nos anos 60, do século XX. Isabel veste uma camisola clara com a gola alta e as mangas compridas; a mesma prende-se a uma saia ligeiramente rodada. Esta saia termina na região acima do joelho mostra algumas pregas largas, espaçadas umas das outras o que denuncia que esta saia é levemente rodada; na frente, na região do cinto, esta peça é decorada com quatro botões claros, a condizer com a camisola. Nos pés conseguimos perceber que Isabel utiliza uns sapatos pretos, com cordões e com um tacão baixo e largo. A adolescência de Isabel foi passada na freguesia de Beiriz, na Póvoa de Varzim, no norte de Portugal. Aos 14 anos Isabel já trabalhava em uma indústria de agasalhos e, por isso, esta era uma roupa que tradicionalmente utilizava no seu dia a dia.

The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers an area of 748,436 acres (1,169 sq mi; 3,029 km2) and sits in four counties: centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera County. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.  Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness.

On average, about four million people visit Yosemite each year, and most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles (18 km2) of Yosemite Valley. The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors for the first time in its history. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864. John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890, one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests, paving the way for the National Park System.","['US', 'United States', 'CA', 'California', 'Yosemite', 'National Park', 'FindYourPark', 'NPS', 'geology', 'sierra', 'autumn', 'leaves', 'Yosemite National Park California United States']",386.0,0.0

Ambassador Williams will meet with the Governor of West Java Ridwan Kamil and with businesses, universities and other leaders, with a focus on the work our two countries are doing together in education, investment, the digital economy and sustainable development.

“I am delighted to make my first official visit to West Java today, to learn more about, and to deepen, the close links between West Java and Australia,” Ambassador Williams said.

“West Java is home to a range of exciting new job creating investments and economic partnerships between our countries, made possible by the Indonesia Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IACEPA). These economic drivers will be increasingly important to support prosperity for Australians and Indonesians alike, as our countries work in close partnership to recover from the COVID pandemic.”

The Ambassador will meet with Australian businesses in West Java to discuss a range of economic expansion and investment opportunities linked to the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.

Meetings with key education partners in the region will present an opportunity to provide an update on future opportunities for student exchange and education cooperation, as our countries recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian Government has announced next steps to reopen its international border in coming months, including broader recognition of vaccines – incorporating recognition of the Sinovac vaccine for inbound travellers (including for students from Indonesia).

The Ambassador will also meet with the Jabar Digital Service, the West Java Government’s digital innovation team, to learn about the role that big data and technological innovation, delivered with Australia’s support, has played in West Java’s COVID response.

Ambassador Williams will also take the opportunity to visit Masjid Raya Bandung.

•MoU Indonesia-Australia tentang Kerja Sama bidang Pertanian ditandatangani pada 27 Januari

•MoU dan pembicaraan tingkat Menteri akan membangun hubungan kami dengan salah satu mitra dagang terpenting Australia


Sebuah Nota Kesepahaman (MoU) Kerja Sama Pertanian ditandatangani di Jakarta hari ini oleh Menteri Pertanian dan Menteri untuk Wilayah Utara Australia, David Littleproud bersama Menteri Pertanian Indonesia, Dr Syahrul Yasin Limpo.

Menteri Littleproud mengatakan MoU tersebut merupakan pengakuan resmi akan perdagangan pertanian nyata yang terjalin di antara negara kita dan keinginan agar perdagangan itu tumbuh.

MoU tersebut merupakan puncak dari kunjungan tiga hari dimana Menteri bertemu dengan para Menteri utama termasuk Menteri Pertanian Indonesia, dan Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian, juga Menteri Tenaga Kerja serta perwakilan agribisnis Indonesia.

“Indonesia adalah pasar ekspor pertanian, perikanan, dan kehutanan terbesar ke-4 di Australia, senilai A$2,9 miliar pada tahun 2020/21,” kata Menteri Littleproud.

“Indonesia adalah pasar gandum terbesar Australia, pasar sapi potong terbesar, dan pasar daging sapi terbesar kelima.

“Perdagangan dua arah untuk sektor pertanian, perikanan dan kehutanan bernilai A$4,07 miliar yang menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia bukan hanya mitra yang disegani namun sekaligus mitra yang dihargai.

“MoU yang ditandatangani hari ini memiliki Kelompok Kerja pelaksana dengan 4 gugus tugas yang akan fokus pada peternakan dan produk hewani, tanaman dan produk tanaman, sistem dan proses modern serta penelitian dan pendidikan pertanian.

“Di bawah MoU, negara-negara kita akan bekerja sama untuk memfasilitasi perdagangan yang saling menguntungkan. Secara sederhana ini adalah hal yang menguntungkan untuk kedua negara kita.

“Selama tiga hari ini saya dapat mengangkat sejumlah isu perdagangan dan akses pasar yang menarik bagi Australia dan menegaskan kembali komitmen saya untuk bekerja bersama Indonesia guna memastikan kedua negara dapat mengambil keuntungan penuh dari Perjanjian Kemitraan Ekonomi Komprehensif Indonesia-Australia.

“Saya juga menyambut baik keterlibatan Indonesia dalam Visa Pertanian Australia dan menyambut kemajuan yang dicapai.”

This is one really frustrated bird.

She has been searching on the ground for around 30-40 seconds and was unable to find the mouse carcass.
Bronson had been working over the same area from above and hadn't made any sighting either.
She is so annonyed that she is picking up and turning over sticks and grass on the ground.

So it would seem that &quot;Super Mouse&quot; may well have lived to tell the tale.
Perhaps it wasn't dead when it dropped and survived the fall into the soft grass and was able to crawl or run into hiding.
No doubt it would have a story to tell the family that night and you can imagine their reaction.
