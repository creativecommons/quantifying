Las Vegas High School
The Las Vegas High School located at 7th and Bridger, was built in 1930. It was the first Art Deco design building in Las Vegas. Its location caused controversy at the time because parents thought the school was too far out of town and students would have to walk too far.

Today that location is surrounded by the City of Las Vegas and within the Resort Corridor. The school building can be seen from higher office windows near Fremont Street. In 1956, 403 students graduated, the largest class in Las Vegas history.

In 1987 the Las Vegas High School building became an historic landmark in a bill signed by then Governor of Nevada Richard Bryan, Las Vegas High School class of 1955 The school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. In 1993 a new Las Vegas High School was built near Sunrise Mountain and the old building became the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts.","['NATM', 'Las Vegas']",80.0,0.0

Nationalmuseum (or National Museum of Fine Arts) is the national gallery of Sweden, located on the peninsula Blasieholmen in central Stockholm.

The museum's operations stretches far beyond the borders of Blasieholmen, the nationalmuseum manage the National Portrait gallery collection at Gripshom, Gustavsbergporclain museum, a handful of castle collections and the Swedish Institute in Paris (Institut Tessin).  In the summer of 2018 Nationalmuseum Jamtli opened in Östersund as a way to show a part of the collection in the north of Sweden.

The museum's benefactors include King Gustav III and Carl Gustaf Tessin. The museum was founded in 1792 as Kungliga Museet (&quot;Royal Museum&quot;). The present building was opened in 1866, when it was renamed the Nationalmuseum, and used as one of the buildings to hold the 1866 General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm.

The current building, built between 1844 and 1866, was inspired by North Italian Renaissance architecture. It is the design of the German architect Friedrich August Stüler, who also designed the Neues Museum in Berlin. The relatively closed exterior, gives no hint of the spacious interior dominated by the huge flight of stairs leading up to the topmost galleries.

The museum was enlarged in 1961 to accommodate the museum workshops. The present restaurant was instated in 1996. The museum building closed for renovation in 2013 and reopened on 13 October 2018. The $132 million overhaul sought to put more of the museum’s collection on display and to match the security, accessibility, fire safety and climate control of a modern institution.

The museum collection consists of about half a million drawings from the Middle Ages to 1900, a prominent 17th-century collection of Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, and a collection of porcelain items, paintings, sculptures, and modern art as well. In total the collection amounts to circa 700 000 objects. The museum also has an art library, open to the public and academics.

Nationalmuseum holds the largest collection of portrait miniatures in the world, with more than 5 200 works.  The collection features miniatures from many European school's, including works by Nicholas Hilliard, Isaac Oliver, Louis-Marie Autissier among others. A significant portion of works derives from the master collector Carl Fredrik Dahlgren, while the more exclusive works were donated by Hjalmar Wicander, a cork factory owner. Production of bottle corks for the brewery industry provided the basis of his fortune. Wicander also donated funds specifically for additional purchases of miniatures

156,,2022-09-19 20:59:51,2.0,"On December 10 (anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death) each year, Oslo City Hall hosts the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in which the annual laureate gives his or her lecture and is awarded the medal and diploma. A podium for the laureate and the Nobel Committee is erected in the far end of the hall for each ceremony. The Norwegian Royal Family and Prime Minister are attendants.

Oslo City Hall houses the city council, the city's administration and various other municipal organisations. The building as it stands today was constructed between 1931 and 1950, with an interruption during the Second World War. It was designed by architects Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson. The building is located in the city center, in the northern part of the Pipervika neighbourhood, and it faces Oslofjord.

Oslo City Hall is built of red brick and has two towers, one 63 meters tall and other 66 meters tall. The bricks used are larger than what was typical at the time of construction, but are roughly the same size as bricks used in the Middle Ages. The bricks, measuring approximately 27.5 × 13 × 8.5 cm, were produced by Hovin Teglverk in Oslo. The eastern tower has a carillon set of 49 bells. Various events and ceremonies take place in the building, notably the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, which takes place every December.

The idea of building a new city hall in Pipervika was first suggested by architect Oscar Hoff in 1906, but nothing came of the plans. In 1915, the idea was taken up by Hieronymus Heyerdahl, who had just stood down as mayor. He noticed the city's lack of a representative city hall to receive the municipality's guests during the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition in Frogner. He set up an architectural competition which received a total of 44 entries in the first of two rounds. In 1918 Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson were selected as winners, whose project was clearly inspired by Stockholm City Hall. A continued lack of funds meant that construction had to wait, and in the intervening years the architects made several changes to the project. In 1930 they present their final draft, which had undergone significant changes, influenced by functionalism. The most apparent change was the addition of two office towers.

The ground stone laying ceremony took place in September 1931, with King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav in attendance. Actual construction began in February 1933. Various buildings were also torn down. The city's old amusement park - Tivoli - was also forced to close as a new zoning plan created new plots of land for sale. The purpose was to raise funds for the construction of the building.

In November 1936 the shell of the building was completed. A few floors of office space were in use by the time war broke out in 1940. Construction resumed after the war and the office space was in use by 1947, while final touches were still being added.

Oslo City Hall was officially opened on 15 May 1950, as part of the city's 900-year anniversary. Three musical compositions were written in connection with the celebrations, written by Ludvig Irgens-Jensen, Eivind Groven and Karl Andersen.

By the time it opened in 1950, the style of the building was no longer popular. Brick was in stark contrast to the steel and glass which architects considered modern at the time, and no further buildings were built in that style afterwards. Stockholm's city hall - also in brick - had been designed by Ragnar Östberg, and Martin Nyrop designed Copenhagen City Hall, which is also a monumental brick building. Both Nyrop and Östberg were on the jury which selected the winning design of Oslo City Hall.

Boasting beautiful landscapes with forests, livestock grazing the green fields, trails, beaches, cafés and several of Norway’s most popular museums are easily accessible by ferry, bus, bike or car from the city centre. The combination of beautiful landscapes, beaches, farmlife and museums that cover a wide range of topics, makes Bygdøy a prime location to visit for families with young children.

At the museums you will experience and learn about the Norwegian spirit, the explorers and history from the Viking age till today. You can also combine the visit to Bygdøy with a sightseeing trip on the fjord.

Bygdøy has a rich history, which includes being farmland for a Cistercian monastery in the Middle Ages and as a hunting and recreation area for the Royal Family. During the mid-1800s King Karl Johan purchased properties from landowners and established a large public park. In 1882 the world's first open-air museum emerged, to tell stories about the Norwegian cultural history.

Today, Bygdøy is characterized by its nature, museums, urban organic farming and everyday life in the residential area. Sustainable development of responsible visitors will preserve the unique qualities of Bygdøy for the future.

Staff members of the Belvoir Hospital join together for a few hours during an Esprit de Corps “One Team Festival” held in the hospital’s garden September 30, 2022.  From food trucks to dunk tanks, from service dogs to Tug-of-War, the opportunity for bonding and socialization, for the first time since the onset of the Pandemic, was met with smiles and a deeper appreciation for this the organization and each other.

The Belvoir Hospital is a 120-bed, 1.3 million-square-foot military community hospital that serves a regional population of 250,000 personnel with about 100,000 enrollees receiving  inpatient and specialty care services supported by 55 specialty clinics, a Warrior Pavilion (for combat injured/wounded/ ill), Inpatient Addictions Program, and three satellite family health centers at the Pentagon, Dumfries and Fairfax, Va.

&quot;Burford is a small medieval town on the River Windrush, in the Cotswold hills, in the West Oxfordshire district of Oxfordshire, England. It is often referred to as the 'gateway' to the Cotswolds. Burford is located 18 miles (29 km) west of Oxford and 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Cheltenham, about 2 miles (3 km) from the Gloucestershire boundary. The toponym derives from the Old English words burh meaning fortified town or hilltown and ford, the crossing of a river. The 2011 Census recorded the population of Burford parish as 1,410 and Burford Ward as 1,847.

The town centre also has some 15th-century houses and the baroque style townhouse that is now Burford Methodist Church. Between the 14th and 17th centuries Burford was important for its wool trade. The Tolsey, midway along Burford's High Street, which was once the focal point for trade, is now a museum.&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

Summer 2019 I did a solo cycling tour across Europe through 12 countries over the course of 3 months. I began my adventure in Edinburgh, Scotland and finished in Florence, Italy cycling 8,816 km. During my trip I took 47,000 photos.

They'd come back and the comments were always the same - it's amazing, the people are lovely, the nature is stunning, the prices are wonderful  And yet, every time I searched for images, even on NatGeo and other outlets, I only saw the same three or four locations photographed. So, with a head full of misconceptions and a certain amount of trepidation II set out to drive and wander western Georgia free-form, with no set agenda, and only a hope I'd make it to the Svaneti region and ultimately the remote village of Ushguli.  What met me was a country full of warm people, incredible nature, spectacular autumn colors, gorgeous mountains, rich history and so much more.

Photos were taken during a 10 day road trip with a four wheel drive vehicle.

It continues to the roof, an area once used for recreation and private conversation.&quot; - info from the Burghley House mini guide.

&quot;Burghley House is a grand sixteenth-century English country house near Stamford, Lincolnshire. It is a leading example of the Elizabethan prodigy house, built and still lived in by the Cecil family. The exterior largely retains its Elizabethan appearance, but most of the interiors date from remodellings before 1800. The house is open to the public and displays a circuit of grand and richly furnished state apartments. Its park was laid out by Capability Brown.

The house is on the boundary of the civil parishes of Barnack and St Martin's Without in the Peterborough unitary authority of Cambridgeshire. It was formerly part of the Soke of Peterborough, an historic area that was traditionally associated with Northamptonshire. It lies 0.9 miles (1.4 km) south of Stamford and 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Peterborough city centre.

The house is now run by the Burghley House Preservation Trust, which is controlled by the Cecil family.

Burghley was built for Sir William Cecil, later 1st Baron Burghley, who was Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I of England, between 1555 and 1587, and modelled on the privy lodgings of Richmond Palace. It was subsequently the residence of his descendants, the Earls, and since 1801, the Marquesses of Exeter. Since 1961, it has been owned by a charitable trust established by the family.

Lady Victoria Leatham, antiques expert and television personality, followed her father, Olympic gold-medal winning athlete, IAAF President and MP, David Cecil, the 6th Marquess, by running the house from 1982 to 2007. The Olympic corridor commemorates her father. Her daughter, Miranda Rock, is now the most active live-in trustee. However, the Marquessate passed it in 1988 to Victoria's uncle, Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter, and then to his son, William Michael Anthony Cecil, both Canadian ranchers on land originally bought by the 5th Marquess, who have not lived at Burghley.

The house is one of the main examples of stonemasonry and proportion in sixteenth-century English Elizabethan architecture, reflecting the prominence of its founder, and the lucrative wool trade of the Cecil estates. It has a suite of rooms remodelled in the baroque style, with carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The main part of the house has 35 major rooms, on the ground and first floors. There are more than 80 lesser rooms and numerous halls, corridors, bathrooms, and service areas.

In the seventeenth century, the open loggias around the ground floor were enclosed. Although the house was built in the floor plan shape of the Letter E, in honour of Queen Elizabeth, it is now missing its north-west wing. During the period of the 9th Earl's ownership, and under the guidance of the famous landscape architect, Capability Brown, the south front was raised to alter the roof line, and the north-west wing was demolished to allow better views of the new parkland. A chimney-piece after the design of Venetian printmaker Giovanni Battista Piranesi was also added during his tenure.

The so-called &quot;Hell Staircase&quot; and its neighbour &quot;The Heaven Room&quot; has substantial ceiling paintings by Antonio Verrio, between 1697 and 1699. The walls to the &quot;Hell Staircase&quot; are by Thomas Stothard, who completed the work about a century later. The Bow Room is decorated with wall and ceiling paintings by Louis Laguerre.&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

&quot;Kings Cliffe (variously spelt King's Cliffe, King's Cliff, Kings Cliff, Kingscliffe) is a village and civil parish on Willow Brook, a tributary of the River Nene, about 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Corby in East Northamptonshire. The parish adjoins the county boundary with the City of Peterborough and the village is about 12 miles (19 km) west of the city centre. The village is not far from the boundary with Lincolnshire and about 6 miles (10 km) south of Stamford.

Hall Yard Farmhouse was built in 1603. Inside the house, Dr Law's Music Room has an 18th-century Georgian coved ceiling with decoration in the style of Robert Adam. Law's Chapel, also 18th century, is nearby.

Parts of Kings Cliffe Manor House are early 17th century.

Kings Cliffe is unusual in having three sets of almshouses. The John Thorpe Almshouses were built in 1668, the Widows' Almshouses in 1749 and the Spinsters' Almshouses in 1754. The Widows' and Spinsters' almshouses were part of a set of charities founded by Rev. Dr William Law (1686–1761) and his disciple, Mrs Elizabeth Hutcheson. A house dating from about 1700 was made a Schoolmaster's House in 1745, and next to it the Boys' School was built in 1748. From 1752 the Schoolmaster's House became Law's Library, which housed Law's religious books and lent them to people of King's Cliffe and neighbouring towns.

King's Cliffe railway station was on a branch line that ran between Seaton and Wansford. The London and North Western Railway opened it in 1879 and British Railways closed it in 1966.

RAF Kings Cliffe was opened in 1942 and returned to agricultural use in 1959. It was about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) east of the village.&quot; info from Wikipedia.

Summer 2019 I did a solo cycling tour across Europe through 12 countries over the course of 3 months. I began my adventure in Edinburgh, Scotland and finished in Florence, Italy cycling 8,816 km. During my trip I took 47,000 photos.

1105,"Sault Ste. Marie, Canada",2019-05-19 11:13:23,2.0,"&quot;Hexham (/ˈhɛksəm/ HEKS-əm) is a market town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, south of the River Tyne, and was the administrative centre for the Tynedale district from 1974 to 2009. In 2011, it had a population of 11,829.

Smaller towns and villages around Hexham include Corbridge, Riding Mill, Stocksfield and Wylam to the east, Acomb and Bellingham to the north, Allendale to the south and Haydon Bridge, Bardon Mill and Haltwhistle to the west. Newcastle upon Tyne is about 25 miles (40 km) to the east and Carlisle is 37 miles (60 km) to the west.

Hexham Abbey originated as a monastery founded by Wilfrid in 674. The crypt of the original monastery survives, and incorporates many stones taken from nearby Roman ruins, probably Corbridge or Hadrian's Wall. The current Hexham Abbey dates largely from the 11th century onward, but was significantly rebuilt in the 19th century. Other notable buildings in the town include the Moot Hall, the covered market, and the Old Gaol.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (Manuscript D: Cotton Tiberius B IV) records the murder of King Ælfwald by Sicga at Scythlecester (which may be modern Chesters) on 23 September 788:

This year Alfwald, king of the Northumbrians, was slain by Siga, on the ninth day before the calends of October; and a heavenly light was often seen on the spot where he was slain. He was buried at Hexham in the church.

The name of Hexham derives from the Old English Hagustaldes ea and later Hagustaldes ham whence the modern form (with the &quot;-ham&quot; element) derives. Hagustald is related to the Old High German hagustalt, denoting a younger son who takes land outside the settlement; the element ea means &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;river&quot; and ham is the Old English form of the Modern English &quot;home&quot; (and the Scots and Northern English &quot;hame&quot;).

Like many towns in the Anglo-Scottish border area and adjacent regions, Hexham suffered from the border wars between the kingdoms of Scotland and England, including attacks from William Wallace who burnt the town in 1297. In 1312, Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, demanded and received £2000 from the town and monastery in order for them to be spared a similar fate. In 1346 the monastery was sacked in a later invasion led by King David II of Scotland.

In 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Hexham was fought somewhere to the south of the town; the actual site is disputed. The defeated Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, was executed in Hexham marketplace. There is a legend that Queen Margaret of Anjou took refuge after the battle in what is known as The Queen's Cave, where she was accosted by a robber; the legend formed the basis for an 18th-century play by George Colman the Younger (The Battle of Hexham: A Comedy in Three Acts); but it has been established that Queen Margaret had fled to France by the time the battle took place. The Queen's Cave in question is on the south side of the West Dipton Burn, to the southwest of Hexham.

Until 1572, Hexham was the administrative centre of the former Liberty or Peculiar of Hexhamshire.

In 1715, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, raised the standard for James Francis Edward Stuart in Hexham Market place. The rising, however, was unsuccessful, and Derwentwater was captured and beheaded after the Battle of Preston.

In 1761, the Hexham Riot took place in the Market Place when a crowd protesting about changes in the criteria for serving in the militia was fired upon by troops from the North Yorkshire Militia. Fifty-one protesters were killed, earning the Militia the sobriquet of The Hexham Butchers.

Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Hexham was a centre of the leather trade, particularly renowned for making gloves known as Hexham Tans—now the name of a vegetarian restaurant in the town.

&quot;Hexham&quot; was used in the Borders as a euphemism for &quot;Hell&quot;. Hence the term &quot;To Hexham wi’ you an’ ye’r whussel!&quot;, recorded in 1873, and the popular expression &quot;Gang to Hexham!&quot;. &quot;Hexham-birnie&quot; is derived from the term and means &quot;an indefinitely remote place&quot;.&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

I suspect this is the Athena that was once displayed at the Air Force Space and Missile Museum at Cape Canaveral

--------------------------

This research missile was used to test Intercontinental Ballistic Missile re-entry vehicles (RVs). Athena simulated the trajectories intercontinental missiles.

Athena was a multi-stage solid-fueled rocket. It could be flown with two, three or four solid-propellant rocket stages depending on the test requirement.

Launched from the Army's Utah Launch Complex at Green River, the missile reached altitudes up to 200 miles before descending to impact on White Sands Missile Range, some 470 miles away. With a flight lasting only four minutes and going to a maximum distance of about 470 miles, Athena could realistically simulate a 25-minute ICBM mission across 5000 miles.

The population of the council area which includes nearby villages was 208,200 as of 2017 and the population of the urban area was 153,717 at the 2011 census. Located at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss, it is the county town of the historic county of Yorkshire. The city is known for its famous historical landmarks such as York Minster and the city walls, as well as a variety of cultural and sporting activities, which makes it a popular tourist destination in England. The local authority is the City of York Council, a single tier governing body responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout the city. The City of York local government district includes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries. It is about 25 miles north-east of Leeds and 34 miles north-west of Kingston upon Hull. York is the largest settlement in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire.

The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD. It became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria and Jórvík. In the Middle Ages, York grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, York became a major hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre, a status it maintained well into the 20th century. During the Second World War, York was bombed as part of the Baedeker Blitz. Although less affected by bombing than other northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration efforts continued into the 1960s.

The economy of York is dominated by services. The University of York and National Health Service are major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy. In 2016, York became sister cities with the Chinese city of Nanjing, as per an agreement signed by the Lord Mayor of York, focusing on building links in tourism, education, science, technology and culture. Today, the city is a popular tourist attraction, especially for international visitors from America, Germany, France and China. In 2017, York became UK's first human rights city, which formalised the city's aim to use human rights in decision making.&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

1145,"Sault Ste. Marie, Canada",2019-05-23 10:16:49,2.0,"&quot;The Abbey of St Mary is a ruined Benedictine abbey in York, England and a Grade I listed building.

Once the richest abbey in the north of England, it lies in what are now the York Museum Gardens, on a steeply-sloping site to the west of York Minster.

The original church on the site was founded in 1055 and dedicated to Saint Olaf II of Norway. After the Norman Conquest the church came into the possession of the Anglo-Breton magnate Alan Rufus who granted the lands to Abbot Stephen and a group of monks from Whitby. The abbey church was refounded in 1088 when the King, William Rufus, visited York in January or February of that year and gave the monks additional lands. The following year he laid the foundation stone of the new Norman church and the site was rededicated to the Virgin Mary. The foundation ceremony was attended by bishop Odo of Bayeux and Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux. The monks moved to York from a site at Lastingham in Ryedale in the 1080s and are recorded there in Domesday. Following a dispute and riot in 1132, a party of reform-minded monks left to establish the Cistercian monastery of Fountains Abbey. In 1137 the abbey was badly damaged by a great fire. The surviving ruins date from a rebuilding programme begun in 1271 and finished by 1294.

The abbey occupied an extensive precinct site immediately outside the city walls, between Bootham and the River Ouse. The original boundary included a ditch and a narrow strip of ground, but the walled circuit was constructed above this in the 1260s in the Abbacy of Simon de Warwick; the walls were nearly three-quarters of a mile long. In 1318 the abbot received royal permission to raise the height of the wall and crenelate it; a stretch of this wall still runs along Bootham and Marygate to the River Ouse.

The gatehouse in Marygate and its lodge formed part of a range of buildings that linked to the older church of St Olave by a chapel dedicated to Mary. Though work on the chapel and gatehouse was under way 1314 and completed in 1320, the surviving structures are mostly of fifteenth-century origin.

The term Stonebow indicates a stone archway that visitors entering the city from the south, along the High Street, would have passed through. The present building was completed around 1520, but has been subject to alterations in about 1840 and in 1885–90.

The Stonebow is built from the local limestone. The exterior has crenellated parapets on both sides. South front has a roll moulded segmental central arch flanked by single round buttresses with canopied niches containing figures. Above, a tablet with pilaster surround with the arms of James I, and above again, two two-light mullioned windows. Over them, there is a stepped gable containing a clock. On either side of the main arch there are two walkway arches, those to the right original, with hoodmoulds.

The North side has a plainer central arch, flanked by a single walkway arch to left and two to the right. Over the inner archways, small two-light windows. Above, three two-light pointed arched windows and parapet gable with clock.

Lincoln is a cathedral city and county town of Lincolnshire in the East Midlands of England. The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln had a 2012 population of 94,600. The 2011 census gave the urban area of Lincoln, which includes North Hykeham and Waddington, a population of 130,200. Roman Lindum Colonia developed from an Iron Age settlement on the River Witham. The city's landmarks include Lincoln Cathedral, an example of English Gothic architecture and the tallest building in the world for over 200 years, and the 11th-century Norman Lincoln Castle. The city is home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University, and to Lincoln City FC and Lincoln United FC.&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

1387,"Sault Ste. Marie, Canada",2019-07-25 10:39:03,2.0,"&quot;Sopron (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈʃopron]; German: Ödenburg, Slovene: Šopron) is a city in Hungary on the Austrian border, near the Lake Neusiedl/Lake Fertő.

When the area that is today Western Hungary was a province of the Roman Empire, a city called Scarbantia stood here. Its forum was located where the main square of Sopron can be found today.

During the Migration Period, Scarbantia was believed to be deserted. By the time Hungarians arrived in the area, it was in ruins. In the 9th–11th centuries, Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls and built a castle. The town was named in Hungarian after a castle steward named Suprun. In 1153, it was mentioned as an important town.

In 1273, King Otakar II of Bohemia occupied the castle. Even though he took the children of Sopron's nobility with him as hostages, the city opened its gates when the armies of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary arrived. The king rewarded Sopron by elevating it to the rank of free royal town.

During the Ottoman occupation of Hungary, the Ottoman Turks ravaged the city in 1529, but did not occupy it. Many Hungarians fled from the occupied areas to Sopron, and the city's importance grew.

While the Ottomans occupied most of central Europe, the region north of lake Balaton remained in the Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867) (captaincy between Balaton and Drava).

In 1676, Sopron was destroyed by a fire. The modern-day city was born in the next few decades, when Baroque buildings were built to replace the destroyed medieval ones. Sopron became the seat of the comitatus Sopron.

The town was the seat of the Ödenburg comitat near 1850. After the compromise of 1867 and until 1918, the city (known with the dual bilingual name of Sopron - Ödenburg) was part of the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Hungary.

Following the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ethnic Germans inhabited parts of four western Hungarian counties: Pozsony (Pressburg in German; Bratislava in Czech/Slovak), Vas (Eisenburg), Sopron (Ödenburg) and Moson (Wieselburg). The German-inhabited parts of these counties were initially awarded to Austria in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). After local unrest and Italian diplomatic mediation in the Venice Protocol, Sopron's status as part of Hungary (along with that of the surrounding eight villages) was decided by a controversial, local plebiscite held on December 14, 1921, with 65% voting for Hungary. Since then Sopron has been called Civitas Fidelissima (&quot;The Most Loyal Town&quot;, Hungarian: A Leghűségesebb Város), and the anniversary of the plebiscite is a city holiday. However, the western parts of Vas, Sopron and Moson counties did join Austria and today form the Austrian federal state of Burgenland, while Pressburg/Pozsony was awarded to Czechoslovakia.

Sopron suffered greatly during World War II, it was bombed several times. The Soviet Red Army captured the city on April 1, 1945. On August 19, 1989, it was the site of the Pan-European Picnic, a protest on the border between Austria and Hungary, which was used by over 600 citizens of East Germany to escape from the GDR to the West. As the first successful crossing of the border it helped pave the way for the mass flight of East German citizens that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.

During the Socialist era, the government tried to turn Sopron into an industrial city, but much of the medieval town center remains, allowing the city to remain an attractive site for tourists.

Today, Sopron's economy immensely benefits from the European Union. Having been a city close to nowhere, that is, to the Iron Curtain, Sopron now has re-established full trade relations to nearby Austria. Furthermore, after being suppressed during the Cold War, Sopron's German-speaking culture and heritage are now recognized again. As a consequence, many of the city's street-and traffic-signs are written in both Hungarian and German making it an officially bilingual city due to its proximity to the Austrian frontier. Visitors admire the large number of buildings in this city that reflect medieval architecture - rare in war-torn Hungary. Situated close to the Austrian border, Sopron receives many visitors from Vienna (70 kilometres (43 miles) away), and from Bratislava, Slovakia (77 km (48 mi) away), as well as from the United States, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Japan, and Scandinavia, who visit to take advantage of the excellent low-cost dental services offered: Sopron boasts so many dental clinics—more than 300—that the city is known as the &quot;dental capital of the world.&quot;&quot; - info from Wikipedia.

The Postal Service responded to the 2001 anthrax attacks by adding biohazard detection equipment to large sorting facilities and creating dangerous mail response teams. Specially-trained inspectors wear hazardous materials suits such as this when gathering evidence in potentially contaminated environments.

To thwart future anthrax-related attacks, the U.S. Postal Service has implemented a Biohazard Detection System (BDS) to help protect the mail. The BDS is an automated process that uses exclusively designed technology to collect and test air samples for biological toxins.

The booster separation motor (BSM) is designed to push the reusable solid rocket motors (RSRM) safely away from the Space Shuttle's main liquid fuel tank and the orbiter itself. At the time of ignition, the BSMS are traveling through the atmosphere at more than 3,000 miles per hour and an altitude of approximately 24 nautical miles. There are eight BSMS attached to each of the two RSRMS, four in the forward skirt and four on the aft-skirt. All 16 BSMS fire simultaneously to ensure a safe launch-to-orbit.","['Space Shuttle', 'SRB', 'ATK', 'Thiokol', 'Rocket Garden', 'Utah', 'Wasatch']",180.0,0.0

Designed by Northrop, the twin-engine dual cockpit F-89 Scorpion was an all-weather fighter-interceptor specifically for the Air Defense Command. With the radar operator in the rear seat guiding the pilot, the F-89 could locate, intercept and destroy enemy aircraft by day or night under all types of weather conditions. The first F-89 made its initial flight in August 1948 and deliveries to the Air Force began in July 1950.

The conventionally designed aircraft had a few unique elements giving it a distinctive character. The position of the horizontal stabilizer high on the tail to avoid turbulence from the engine exhaust, gave the F-89 the appearance of a scorpion with its tail raised to strike. Its low-slung engine intakes earned the F-89 a reputation as the “world's largest vacuum cleaner&quot; by picking up litter from the runway. Inlet screens were not the answer, since at extremely high altitudes, the screens became completely clogged with ice. Later, retractable inlet screens were installed.

With a nose full of electronic sensing equipment and wing-tip pods that carried up to 104 aerial rockets or six Falcon air-to-air missiles with range of 4.5 nautical miles, the Scorpion became the first nuclear-armed interceptor carrying two AIR-2 Genie nuclear air-to-air missiles. It was the heaviest armed fighter in the Air Defense Command with the mission to intercept and attack, enemy bombers approaching the United States. On July 19, 1957, an F-89J (a modified F-89D) fired a Genie test rocket with a nuclear warhead, and it detonated over a Nevada test range. It marked the first launch of an air-to-air rocket with a nuclear warhead. Northrop converted 350 F-89Ds to J models, Air Defense Command's first fighter-interceptor to carry nuclear armament.

The F-89J flew until the early 1960s when sufficient numbers of Genie-equipped F-101 and F-106 fighters became available. Before their retirement, the F-89 had equipped 39 active Air Force units and 17 ANG squadrons. Phaseout began in 1959 from the Air Force and by 1962 there were 9 ANG squadrons still equipped with F-89s and by 1969 all had been retired from the service.

The museum F-89J, serial number 52-1949, was delivered to the Air Force on 4 November 1954. It was first assigned to the 65th FIS Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. It later transferred to the Wisconsin ANG and in 1962 to the 132nd FG, Iowa ANG. It retired in May 1969 and in June 1981 it was transported the museum. This aircraft is on loan from the NMUSAF","['F-89J', 'Scorpion', 'F-89', '52-1949']",451.0,0.0

The production was interrupted March 1, the first day of tech week, and postponed some months because of COVID-19 measures.
At the end of the lockdown, the cast members directed by Jerry Brees started to re-rehearse following safety measures, made some changes and got ready again during summer.
Because of the postponement and the several months from the original version, some of the cast members were unable to do the show based on PCS-ing, training commitments and staring college.
This production is U.S. Army Garrison Italy's entry in the 2020 IMCOM-Europe Tournament of the Festival of Plays.

Burguete (Auritz en euskera y, de forma oficial, Auritz/Burguete) es un municipio español de la Comunidad Foral de Navarra, situado en la merindad de Sangüesa, en el partido judicial de Aoiz, en las comarca de Auñamendi y Pirineo Navarro y a 45 km de la capital de la comunidad, Pamplona.

Asentado sobre un antiguo camino la morfología de la villa queda caracterizada por la actual calle de San Nicolás; conocida en otras épocas como calle Única o avenida Roncesvalles y que corresponde a la actual N-135 (Pamplona - Valcarlos) es decir tiene una estructura de pueblo-calle.

La reparcelación medieval como pueblo-calle hacía que las casas en su origen estuvieran muy juntas separadas por los etxekartes o mokartes, no obstante el cambio de las condiciones de vida recientes ha hecho que la hoy calle San Nicolás muestre un juego de llenos y vacíos en contraste con su fuerte linealidad, reforzada además por los canales que la flanquean por los lados y suavizada por la ligera curva de su trazado.

La calle se puede dividir en dos partes caracterizada cada una por la tipología de sus edificios, la original que va de Oloriz a Aguio y la prolongación o ensanche de finales del XIX y principios del XX, que va de Espelosin a Errotaldea.

Mediante el Decreto Foral 98/2008, se declaró Bien de Interés Cultural el Conjunto Histórico de Auritz/Burguete,​ protegiendo así el buen estado de conservación de la trama urbana y sus peculiaridades edificatorias. Tras esta declaración el Ayuntamiento elaboró el correspondiente Plan Especial de Protección, que regula su conservación y mejora urbana; el Plan Especial de Protecciónb​ fue aprobado por acuerdo del Pleno del Ayuntamiento del 1 de febrero de 2011.

Burguete (Auritz in Basque and, officially, Auritz/Burguete) is a Spanish municipality in the Autonomous Community of Navarra, located in the Sangüesa merindad, in the Aoiz judicial district, in the Auñamendi and Navarrese Pyrenees region and 45 km from the capital of the community, Pamplona.

Settled on an old road, the morphology of the town is characterized by the current street of San Nicolás; known in other times as Calle Única or Avenida Roncesvalles and which corresponds to the current N-135 (Pamplona - Valcarlos), that is, it has a town-street structure.

The medieval reparcelling as a town-street meant that the houses were originally very close together, separated by the etxekartes or mokartes, however the recent change in living conditions has made the current San Nicolás street show a game of full and empty in contrast with its strong linearity, further reinforced by the channels that flank it on the sides and softened by the slight curve of its layout.

The street can be divided into two parts, each one characterized by the typology of its buildings, the original one that goes from Oloriz to Aguio and the extension or widening from the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, which goes from Espelosin to Errotaldea.

Through Provincial Decree 98/2008, the Historic Complex of Auritz/Burguete was declared an Asset of Cultural Interest, thus protecting the good state of conservation of the urban fabric and its building peculiarities. Following this declaration, the City Council drew up the corresponding Special Protection Plan, which regulates its conservation and urban improvement; The Special Protection Plan was approved by agreement of the City Council Plenary on February 1, 2011.","['iPhone 365', 'iPhone X', 'Landscape', 'Natura', 'Naturaleza', 'Nature', 'Vaches', 'Cow', 'Vaques', 'Vacas', 'España', 'Navarra', 'Auritz/Burguete']",2163.0,231.0

Constructed in 1981, the 7-foot stone monument features a sculpted Maltese Cross, the traditional symbol of the fire service. At the base of the monument an eternal flame symbolizes the spirit of all firefighters — past, present and future. Plaques encircling the monument list the names of the men and women of the fire service who have died in service to their communities since 1981. Whenever a firefighter dies in the line-of-duty, fire officials post a notice of the death at the monument and lower flags at the site to half-staff.

Each year, America honors its fallen fire heroes during a National Memorial Service at the monument site. The ceremony includes the placing of a Presidential Wreath at the monument and dedication of a plaque honoring those who died in the line-of-duty during the previous year.","['firefighting', 'firefighter', 'fire memorial', 'Maryland', 'FEMA']",100.0,0.0

A sensitive restoration, it laid the garden out as it had been in the mid 19th century. In addition to some lovely shrubs, it features a thatched summerhouse, a medieval stone arch, a brick gazebo to heat a pineapple frame, and what claims to be a stone Nilometer from Ancient Egypt. This is a glimpse of the Master's House, and even at this dismal time of the year the garden had some plants in flower.

The Columbia XJL-1 was intended as a replacement for the Grumman J2F Duck amphibious bi-plane for the US Navy. Originally designed by Grumman, it was turned over to the Columbia Aircraft Corporation for development and construction. The plane bears a strong resemblance to the Duck, but it is a completely new design. Three XJL-1s were built. This aircraft is the last of the three, completed in 1946 and accepted by the Navy on October 29, 1947. The XJL did not live up to expectations, with repeated structural failures. Testing was abandoned on September 21, 1948 and the aircraft were stricken from the Navy's inventory in February 1949.

Both flight test aircraft were sold to Martin Aircraft engineer Herbert Scudder for $420. He worked at restoring them until his death in 1955. In 1957, this XJL-1 was sold to Len Redman of Chicago by Scudder's widow on the condition that the plane had to fly at least once. In October of that year, the XJL was flown to Chicago. The aircraft would have three more owners before being loaned to the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in 1987, and eventually donated in December of 2000. The plane has less than 200 flight hours.

As I approached his million-dollar store I saw a crowd in front of the windows. His windows are always an attraction. Displayed there are goods of all kinds at marvelous prices. They are arrayed in a free and easy way, and there is plenty of dust on them. Two items. I noticed, were lZ-dollar fishing-rods at 49 cents, and fast black hosiery at 40 cents a dozen.

1c1. best signature
Huge bold signature in brown ink on a 3½&quot; X 3 3/4&quot; slip below a partial &quot;Yrs truly&quot; penned in another hand, n.p., n.y. Near fine. Minor mounting traces on verso. At the bottom of this slip is penned &quot;Charles Broadway Rouss / The blind millionaire&quot; in another hand. An incredibly stylized and bizarre signature which, once deciphered, appears to read &quot;C B Rouss&quot; -- one of the most unusual signatures ever, not to mention quite scarce.

&quot;I say to you that I know but one thought and that thought is my business. -
That is a passion with me amounts to madness and drives me -
on with the fury and pitiless rage of a demon. No rest do I know, -
nor do I care, nor want any.


I love with all my soul its merciless and savage energy. -
Where it may end God knows! -
In greatness or misery and day and night, Sunday and weekday, -
I love and feast upon the hours I call my own, driving this -
vast and frightful engine. Not this side of the grave do I look -
for rest. These are thoughts I pour out to you and have never -
uttered to a living soul.&quot;

Among them was the colorful George Francis Train--the entrepreneur who organized the clipper ship line around Cape Horn to San Francisco, organized the Union Pacific Railroad and ran for President in 1872.  In his later years, George Francis Train spent much of his time in Madison Square, speaking to children and feeding animals, but refusing to address adults -- photograph from the collection of the Library of Congress

Addison Archer of the Hardware Dealer’s Magazine wanted to ask C.B. if he was going blind.

Could he still delight in scattering pennies from the back of a street car and see the scrounging urchin boys? Or can he only enjoy the ring of the pennies on concrete?

The Rouss System has paralyzed the Ledger Legions and has changed the caracter of modern mercantile rivalry. Under the primitive methods, no madr whether for cash, credit, or barter, there was the regular markup, from fifty to two thousand per cent, and the code of the autocrats wd not permit the slitest deviation; tha all maintained the price, and it ground with merciles severity the laboring poor into the very dust. In turn the credit cancer had eten the very vitals of proud hi-toned, aristocratic combination. The public stands stupefied and amazed when tha realize the gigantic plundering of thes ledger prices. Yes, the ledger-keeping credit records is doomed and damd. Within the fatal folds of the credit records have been crushed the grandest ambitions that ever fired the immortal soul.

1c1. best signature
Huge bold signature in brown ink on a 3½&quot; X 3 3/4&quot; slip below a partial &quot;Yrs truly&quot; penned in another hand, n.p., n.y. Near fine. Minor mounting traces on verso. At the bottom of this slip is penned &quot;Charles Broadway Rouss / The blind millionaire&quot; in another hand. An incredibly stylized and bizarre signature which, once deciphered, appears to read &quot;C B Rouss&quot; -- one of the most unusual signatures ever, not to mention quite scarce.

&quot;I say to you that I know but one thought and that thought is my business. -
That is a passion with me amounts to madness and drives me -
on with the fury and pitiless rage of a demon. No rest do I know, -
nor do I care, nor want any.


I love with all my soul its merciless and savage energy. -
Where it may end God knows! -
In greatness or misery and day and night, Sunday and weekday, -
I love and feast upon the hours I call my own, driving this -
vast and frightful engine. Not this side of the grave do I look -
for rest. These are thoughts I pour out to you and have never -
uttered to a living soul.&quot;

Among them was the colorful George Francis Train--the entrepreneur who organized the clipper ship line around Cape Horn to San Francisco, organized the Union Pacific Railroad and ran for President in 1872.  In his later years, George Francis Train spent much of his time in Madison Square, speaking to children and feeding animals, but refusing to address adults -- photograph from the collection of the Library of Congress

Addison Archer of the Hardware Dealer’s Magazine wanted to ask C.B. if he was going blind.

Could he still delight in scattering pennies from the back of a street car and see the scrounging urchin boys? Or can he only enjoy the ring of the pennies on concrete?

The Rouss System has paralyzed the Ledger Legions and has changed the caracter of modern mercantile rivalry. Under the primitive methods, no madr whether for cash, credit, or barter, there was the regular markup, from fifty to two thousand per cent, and the code of the autocrats wd not permit the slitest deviation; tha all maintained the price, and it ground with merciles severity the laboring poor into the very dust. In turn the credit cancer had eten the very vitals of proud hi-toned, aristocratic combination. The public stands stupefied and amazed when tha realize the gigantic plundering of thes ledger prices. Yes, the ledger-keeping credit records is doomed and damd. Within the fatal folds of the credit records have been crushed the grandest ambitions that ever fired the immortal soul.

BELL OH-58D KIOWA WARRIOR
SERIAL NUMBER 93-0976

Current Markings: United States Army, 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, Fort Drum, New York, 2015

The Bell OH-58D Kiowa was developed from the earlier OH-58A as a part of the U.S. Army's Helicopter Improvement Program in the early 1980s. The helicopter incorporated a more powerful engine and transmission as well as a four-bladed rotor which decreased the aircraft's noise level while improving low level performance. The distinctive Mast Mounted Sight above the main rotor allowed the helicopter to scout for targets without rising above trees or hills. In the late 1980s improvements to the helicopter's armament systems allowed the Kiowa to carry hellfire anti-tank missiles, unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine guns. This armed version was called the Kiowa Warrior. The Army deployed Kiowa Warriors extensively in both Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 35 were lost in combat. The last OH-58Ds were retired from Army service in 2016.

This helicopter was assigned to 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, Ft. Drum, New York. During its service, it deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2015 it retired to storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona as part of the retirement of all the U.S. Army's Kiowa Warriors.

OSHKOSH TYPE A / S32P-4 FIREFIGHTING TRUCK
SERIAL NUMBER 14053

Current Markings: Northrop Grumman, circa 2010

The Oshkosh P-4 was designed in the early 1970s to a United States military request for a modern aero-space firefighting truck that could be air transported by a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The resulting design carried 1,680 gallons of water or foam, pumping it at a maximum of 1,200 gallons per minute. The water or foam was discharged from two remotely controlled turrets, one on top of the cab and one on the bumper. Water and foam could also distributed by a handline. The 425 horsepower diesel engine and 6 x 6 drive gave the P-4 the ability to reach fires off of paved surfaces and in severe weather. P-45 went into service around 1975 with various militaries, and airports around the world, with the largest user being the United States Air Force which purchased over 500 trucks.

As I approached his million-dollar store I saw a crowd in front of the windows. His windows are always an attraction. Displayed there are goods of all kinds at marvelous prices. They are arrayed in a free and easy way, and there is plenty of dust on them. Two items. I noticed, were lZ-dollar fishing-rods at 49 cents, and fast black hosiery at 40 cents a dozen.

98. Should fortune with a smiling face strew roses in our way,
When shall we stop to pick them up?

When shall we grieve, if grieve we must?
101. Tomorrow.

As I approached his million-dollar store I saw a crowd in front of the windows. His windows are always an attraction. Displayed there are goods of all kinds at marvelous prices. They are arrayed in a free and easy way, and there is plenty of dust on them. Two items. I noticed, were lZ-dollar fishing-rods at 49 cents, and fast black hosiery at 40 cents a dozen.

what time do you get down here in the morning?”

140.
**
“Six o’clock; I used to get down at five.&quot;
141.
“Every day in the year?”
142.
“Except Sundays.”
143.
&quot; How late do you stay at night? &quot;
144.
“Six o’clock;
145.
but now look at here,
146.
you are a stenographer, aren't you? &quot;
147.
“No; but I can take everything you say verbatim.&quot;

“Well, then you can understand
149.
that I want to get through with my stenographers before seven o'clock.

150.
 I don’t like to keep them here after that.”
151.
“Mr. Rouss, what time do you go to bed at night?”
152.
“Eight o’clock.
153.
I suppose you are one of those all-night tellers who go to bed twelve, two o’clock, four o’clock-&quot;
154
“I sometimes write at night.&quot; I replied.

155.

“That isn't right,
156.
do your work in the daytime”

“Eight o’clock.

I suppose you are one of those all-night tellers who go to bed twelve, two o’clock, four o’clock-&quot;

“I sometimes write at night.&quot; I replied.

As I approached his million-dollar store I saw a crowd in front of the windows. His windows are always an attraction. Displayed there are goods of all kinds at marvelous prices. They are arrayed in a free and easy way, and there is plenty of dust on them. Two items. I noticed, were lZ-dollar fishing-rods at 49 cents, and fast black hosiery at 40 cents a dozen.

As I approached his million-dollar store I saw a crowd in front of the windows. His windows are always an attraction. Displayed there are goods of all kinds at marvelous prices. They are arrayed in a free and easy way, and there is plenty of dust on them. Two items. I noticed, were lZ-dollar fishing-rods at 49 cents, and fast black hosiery at 40 cents a dozen.

It was also the day before the annual air show featuring the USN Blue Angels so we hoped for a full practice run through. Things were a bit off on this day - storms had passed through all morning delaying things. The Blues finally took off and started their antics when after about 15 minutes Blue Angels 1 and 3 landed and pulled off on a taxiway for about 15 minutes. We didn't see any vehicles approach so we were a bit mystified. They eventually took off and resumed the practice. By then the sun broke through and it was so bright - it made for very harsh shooting conditions. Despite all this they put on a great practice and we really look forward to seeing them again.

SPACE SHUTTLE TIRE
Manufactured by B.F. Goodrich, the main landing gear (MLG) tire on display was installed on the shuttle Atlantis for mission STS-66 in May 1994.

The STS-66 mission: The science package on board STS-66 consisted of a multi-national package focused on studies of atmospheric ozone degradation through chemical alteration and solar radiation.

Interesting Facts Courtesy of NASA
- Number of tires on the space shuttle:
4 main landing gear tires 44.5x16.0-21, 34 ply, 263 mph
2 nose landing gear tires 32x8.8, 20 ply, 250 mph
- The space shuttle tires are filled with nitrogen (as are most aircraft tires) due to its stability at different altitudes and temperatures. Due to extremely heavy loads, the tires are inflated to 340 psi (main gear) and 300 psi (nose gear).
- Shuttle tires temperatures range in excess of -40 degrees Fahrenheit in space to +130 degrees Fahrenheit on landing in a matter of minutes. The main landing gear shuttle tires are only used one time and the nose landing gear tires are typically used for two landings.
- Since weight is of extreme importance, the tires are made with a minimum amount of tread to conserve weight, allowing for larger payloads. A few pounds may not seem to make much difference, but when you add up all the ways to decrease weight throughout the shuttle, it can have a significant impact.

O SIM visa melhorar a vida dos contagenses, garantindo um transporte coletivo mais ágil, seguro e de qualidade para a população. O Corredor Leste-Oeste vai facilitar o deslocamento dos moradores da região do Petrolândia às regiões da Ressaca/Nacional e vice-versa.  Na sequência da visita, Marília Campos também esteve no canteiro de obras do Terminal Ressaca e a na duplicação do Viaduto Ceasa.

Acompanhada pelo vice-prefeito Ricardo Faria e do presidente da Transcon, Renato Ribeiro, Marília falou sobre o compromisso da gestão com a continuidade das obras. Segundo ela, as intervenções têm mobilizado os esforços da Prefeitura. “Essa retomada tem rendido muito trabalho da nossa equipe, de rever projetos, fazer reequilíbrio de contrato, novas licitações, dentre outras ações. Hoje, esse terminal não está funcionando por essa razão. Mas, tenho certeza de que vamos encontrar uma solução para garantir um transporte mais ágil e de melhor qualidade para a população de Contagem”, ressaltou a prefeita.

O vice-prefeito Ricardo Faria enalteceu o diálogo da Prefeitura com os moradores da cidade. “É muito importante essa transparência de comunicar para a população o que está acontecendo, principalmente,  sobre como assumimos essas obras e o que estamos fazendo para entregá-las”, afirmou.

O presidente da Transcon, Renato Guimarães Ribeiro, reforçou a posição da prefeita sobre os ajustes no corredor e no terminal desativado. Segundo ele, o Terminal Petrolândia chegou a ser inaugurado no ano passado, mas foi fechado por conta de problemas na infraestrutura e de operação do local. “Temos que refazer algumas obras complementares ao terminal, pois elas ainda não são suficientes para entregar um serviço de qualidade para a população. Vamos rever todo o projeto para adequá-lo ao sistema de transporte coletivo. Precisamos terminar as obras, melhorar os acessos e colocar o terminal para funcionar para a população”, disse.

As administradoras regionais do Petrolândia, Márcia Ramalho, do Nacional, Janete Romão e da Ressaca, Maria José Pacheco também participaram das vistorias às obras do Corredor Leste-Oeste.

CORREDOR LESTE-OESTE

O Corredor Leste-Oeste vai integrar as regionais Petrolândia, Ressaca e Nacional. Com 11 quilômetros de extensão, vai ligar os dois extremos da cidade por meio da Via Expressa e avenidas Helena de Vasconcelos Costa e Severino Ballesteros Rodrigues.

Parte do SIM, o corredor tem como pontos extremos dois terminais: no leste o Terminal Ressaca e no oeste o Terminal Petrolândia. Juntos, os terminais vão possibilitar a integração do transporte coletivo entre as regionais Ressaca, Nacional e Petrolândia, sem a necessidade de pagar outra tarifa.

No atual sistema, os usuários têm que pagar duas tarifas para fazer a conexão entre as regiões. Embarcam em um coletivo na região do Petrolândia, descem no Centro de Contagem ou no Eldorado, e pegam outra condução até a Ressaca ou Nacional. O mesmo acorre para quem quer fazer o caminho oposto, ir das regiões da Ressaca e do Nacional para a regional Petrolândia.

Nesse corredor as faixas exclusivas para os ônibus serão do tipo BRS (Bus Rapid Service, serviço de ônibus rápido, em português), com circulação preferencial à direita das vias. Além disso, todos os pontos de embarque e desembarque do corredor passarão por readequações. Serão 25 pontos na extensão do corretor e todos contarão com painéis de informação com previsão de chegada dos coletivos. Atualmente, Contagem conta com 46 desses displays espalhados pela cidade.

O Corredor Leste-Oeste ainda terá conexões com o Corredor Ressaca, no terminal homônimo, e com o Corredor Norte-Sul, no Terminal Sede, integrando todo o novo sistema de transporte coletivo do município.

This funding is being used by longstanding USAID partner, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), working with Timor-Leste’s State Secretariat for Civil Protection, to provide house repair kits, including roofing sheets, as well as kitchen utensils, bedding, and other household items, in order to assist families to return to their homes.

“I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Timorese families and friends who have lost loved ones, homes and belongings as a result of the flooding,” said Ambassador Blackstone.  “My team at the U.S. Mission to Timor-Leste and I worked quickly to make this funding available to support the people of Timor-Leste at this difficult time. The American people have a long tradition of helping friends in need.”

Immediately after the flooding, the U.S. Navy Seabees in Timor-Leste provided assistance to the Red Cross and Government of Timor-Leste’s Civil Protection Agency and today provided sleeping cots to evacuees at the September 4 school.

On April 3 and 4, 2021, torrential rainfall measuring over 300 millimeters caused severe flooding in the capital of Dili and other areas of the country.  According to the Government of Timor-Leste, thousands of people have lost their homes as a result of the flooding and are in shelters.  Nineteen preliminary evacuation sites have been set up, including in churches.

Kaman began development of the Huskie in 1950 for the Navy and Marine Corps.  The prototype first flew in 1953.  The helicopter’s twin intermeshed rotor configuration eliminates the need for a tail rotor, but the angle at which they must be mounted forces the rotor blades to approach very near the ground when the aircraft is landed making it difficult to get close to the aircraft while the rotors are turning.  The early Huskies used by the Navy and Marine Corps used a radial aircraft engine, while the later Air Force version used a turbine engine.

<a href=""https://boothmuseum.org/exhibitions/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">boothmuseum.org/exhibitions/</a>

The world’s largest permanent exhibition space for Western art is in Cartersville, Georgia at the Booth Western Art Museum.
Open since 2003 and located just north of Atlanta along I-75, the Booth is the largest museum of its kind in the Southeast and an Affiliate to the Smithsonian Institution. At 120,000 square feet, the Booth is an architectural wonder – designed to resemble a modern pueblo and constructed from Bulgarian limestone. The Booth’s permanent collection of Western art, Presidential portraits and letters, and Civil War art allows visitors to “See America’s Story” – the land, people, struggles, dreams, and legends – in paintings, sculpture, photography and artifacts. Sagebrush Ranch is an award-winning, hands-on experience and interactive children’s gallery.
Western art in Georgia, specifically Cartersville? Booth Museum was started by a family who call Cartersville home and have been Western art collectors for many years. It was their wish to share their art with the community, particularly young people who might not otherwise be exposed to art. The Museum was named for Sam Booth, a good friend and mentor to the founders of the Museum. Booth Western Art Museum is operated under the umbrella of Georgia Museums, Inc., which also includes Tellus Science Museum, Bartow History Museum and, coming soon, Savoy Automobile Museum.
Since opening, more than 3/4 million people have visited the Booth. As the buzz surrounding the Booth continues to grow, so does the Museum’s accolades, including being named the 2016 Escape to the Southeast Travel Attraction of the Year by the Southeast Tourism Society, 2016 Reader’s Choice “Best Western Museum” in America by True West Magazine, listed among “The South’s Best Museums” by Southern Living, top 10 ranking in “30 Must-See Art Museums In The U.S.” by thecareerartproject.com, and one of “5 U.S. Art Museums to Add to Your Bucket List” by thedailyquirk.com.

The Booth’s permanent collection covers more than a dozen galleries, showcasing legendary artists such as Frederic Remington and Charles Russell to contemporary masters Howard Terpning and Andy Warhol. Unique to the Booth, the Millar Presidential Gallery displays a portrait and original hand-signed letter from each U.S. President, George Washington through Donald Trump. Supplementing the permanent collection are several temporary galleries, hosting 10 to 12 exhibitions per year.

In addition to “Seeing America’s Story” in our galleries, visitors can experience American heritage through several annual events, plus lectures, programing, and exhibition openings. Each February the For the Love of Art Gala Weekend features live and silent art auctions generating funds needed to help support the Museum’s mission. Every March the Southeastern Cowboy Gathering features traditional Cowboy food, music and poetry. October brings the Southeastern Cowboy Festival &amp; Symposium with Native American dancing, gun fight reenactments, art history lectures, a Western marketplace and much more. The museum also welcomes visiting artists and scholars to speak at twice monthly lectures and exhibition openings throughout the year.",[],285.0,0.0

O auditório da Prefeitura de Contagem recebeu, na quinta-feira (7/10), mais uma etapa das pré-conferências para a IV Conferência de Políticas Urbana, que promoverá a revisão do plano diretor do município – lei municipal que estabelece regras, parâmetros, incentivos e instrumentos para o desenvolvimento da cidade. O encontro foi segmentado, participando da elaboração do diagnóstico da ocupação do território municipal comerciantes, empresários e empreendedores envolvidos diretamente do desenvolvimento econômico do município. Também estiveram presentes a prefeita Marília Campos, o secretário municipal de Desenvolvimento Urbano, Isnard Monteiro, acompanhado da subsecretária da pasta, Samantha Sant’Anna e a vereadora Moara Saboia, líder do Governo na Câmara dos Vereadores.

Quatro temas norteiam a revisão do plano diretor: Águas na Cidade, quando se debate as políticas públicas para drenagem urbana, a preservação das bacias hidrográficas, o saneamento básico e o meio ambiente no espaço urbano. Cidade em Movimento, eixo no qual é discutida a mobilidade urbana, a mobilidade ativa, o trânsito, o transporte de pessoas e de cargas e intervenções para acessibilidade; Cidade em Construção, onde a discussão entra na densidade construtiva do município, na cidade compacta (densidades populacionais equilibradas em diferentes pontos do município) na produção de espaço, na centralidade e nas políticas de habitação. Por fim, Cidade com cidadania, quando a conferência trata da regularização fundiária, do patrimônio cultural e da agricultura urbana.

Na abertura dos debates, a chefe do Executivo destacou a preocupação sobre a preservação da bacia de Várzea das Flores. Ela apontou que a ocupação da região onde está situada a represa, tanto a desordenada quanto a ordenada, criam adensamento populacional que compromete o espelho d’água. “Ainda quando deputada estadual, representando a Assembleia Legislativa de Minas Gerais no Conselho Metropolitano, defendi a realização de um plano diretor metropolitano, para a elaboração ampliada de uma proposta de zoneamento e organização de espaços urbanos de várias áreas de interesse metropolitano. Entre essas áreas, coloquei especialmente a bacia de Várzea das Flores”, destacou a prefeita.

A represa de Vargem das Flores contribui com o abastecimento hídrico de Betim, Contagem e Belo Horizonte. Ela faz parte do Sistema de Abastecimento Paraopeba, que engloba também os reservatórios de Rio Manso e Serra Azul. Com o período de estiagem crítico em todo o país, Vargem das Flores vem apresentando níveis muito baixos em seu reservatório.

A prefeita reconheceu a contribuição dos setores econômicos com a arrecadação do município, com a geração de emprego e o desenvolvimento de modo mais geral da cidade. “Contagem tem várias vantagens competitivas, entre elas, ser entrecortada por várias das principais vias e ligação com outras importantes regiões do país”, disse Marília, que ponderou: “Mas nós não podemos fazer um desenvolvimento a qualquer custo. Fico atenta à arrecadação e ao desenvolvimento econômico, mas também me preocupo com a população. O Plano Diretor reordenará o espaço urbano, conciliando o interesse dos empreendedores com o da população de Contagem, especialmente no que diz respeito à questão ambiental”.

Yuri Martins Sato, da empresa Sato Engenheiros e Associados, que trabalha projetos arquitetônicos e estruturais, destacou a relevância da inclusão dos empresários no debate sobre o crescimento da cidade. “O empresário também promove o desenvolvimento econômico do município, por isso é importante que ele participe de todas as instâncias democráticas da cidade. É necessário escutar a população, mas também os empreendedores. Isso equilibra o que é bom para a população, mas que também contribua com o ambiente de negócios”.

Pedro Henrique Fonseca, representando a Construtora Dez, também reafirmou o êxito do encontro. “Debater o novo plano diretor é essencial. O plano diretor vigente tem inconsistências e também tiramos como encaminhamentos a digitalização e modernização dos processos de licenciamento do município”, concluiu.

Ao final do evento foram eleitos 14 delegados representantes do setor produtivo, que participarão da IV Conferência de Políticas Urbana, onde as propostas serão apresentadas para efetiva elaboração do Plano Diretor.","['Contagem', 'MG', 'Brasil', 'plenária', 'plano diretor', 'PREFEITURA MUNICIPAL DE CONTAGEM', 'Marília Campos']",119.0,0.0

Design work for what would become the B-52 Stratofortress began in 1945.  After several major design changes, the first of the eight-engined bombers took to the air on October 2, 1952.  The first of the eight major production variants of the B-52 were built in 1954, with production continuing through 1963.  The fourth model of the B-52 built, the B-52D was the second most produced version of the Stratofortress.  Delivery of the “D” models began in 1956 with a total of 170 built.

As they were first built, the “D” model was virtually identical to earlier models of the aircraft except that it lacked the reconnaissance ability of earlier B-52s and was intended purely as a bomber.  In 1965, modification of B-52D aircraft began to increase their conventional bomb load.  The “Big Belly” modifications resulted in the ability to carry a total 108 conventional bombs both internally and externally.  This means that one aircraft could carry 54,000 pounds of bombs, roughly the equivalent of nine World War Two B-17s.  B-52s dropped thousands of tons of bombs on targets in Vietnam, becoming the symbol of American strategic air power during that war.

O maior educador brasileiro, reconhecido mundialmente, Paulo Freire dizia que “ensinar não é transferir conhecimento, mas criar as possibilidades para a sua própria produção ou a sua construção.” E essas possibilidades por Freire citadas se referem a diversos fatores importantes presentes no processo de educação, como o local onde se constrói o conhecimento e também as ferramentas disponíveis para tal construção. Na manhã desta terça-feira (14/12), a prefeita de Contagem, Marília Campos, visitou o Cemei Arvoredo, onde pode ver na prática o que o educador falou em seus ensinamentos. Acompanhada do vice-prefeito Ricardo Faria, da secretária de Educação, Telma Fernanda Ribeiro, da administradora Regional Ressaca, Maria José Pacheco, e da vereadora Silvinha Dudu, a comitiva foi guiada pela diretora do espaço, a professora Ana Paula Rodrigues de Souza, por uma super estrutura em termos  de qualidade e acolhedora para receber crianças de zero a 5 anos de idade.

Com um modelo moderno e funcional, o Cemei Arvoredo funciona em dois blocos. O bloco A para crianças de zero a três anos conta com duas salas amplas, com solário, estrutura de berçário, um lactário, uma lavanderia, além de refeitório, almoxarifado e sala de professores.  O bloco B, destinado aos alunos de 4 a 5 anos, é um espaço com oito salas igualmente amplas com boa ventilação, além de uma sala multiuso, que serve a creche e a pré-escola. O prédio foi construído nos mínimos detalhes pensando nas necessidades das crianças e de como ensiná-las desde pequenas a se apropriarem e aprenderem o funcionamento de equipamentos como pias para lavar as mãos, bebedouros, sanitários, áreas para banhos. Todos em “miniatura”, instalados na altura dos pequenos e pequenas, estimulando-os assim à independência e autonomia desde a infância.  A importância de todo equipamento estar na altura delas é porque “na educação infantil  todas as atividades são currículos, pois o tempo cronológico das crianças é diferenciado”. Na unidade, o respeito ainda pode ser sentido pelo pé ao pisar o piso tátil e com os espaços acessíveis, incluindo o banheiro, configurado às necessidades das crianças portadoras de alguma deficiência.

Uma novidade que trouxe tranquilidade tanto para os servidores quanto para as famílias que têm filhos atendidos na unidade é a presença 24 horas durante toda a semana dos porteiros da prestadora de serviços MGS,  que também é responsável pela limpeza.

Por causa da pandemia o Cemei Arvoredo, que tem capacidade para mais de 300 alunos e alunas, está presencialmente com apenas 114, que vão à unidade três vezes na semana com carga horária reduzida de três horas diárias. Segundo informou Ana Paula Rodrigues de Souza, o retorno gradual aconteceu em  agosto com dez turmas, sendo cinco no diurno e outras cinco no vespertino.  “Devido a pandemia, as turmas foram reduzidas, e só devem voltar ao normal, se o controle da pandemia se mantiver, com 20 turmas no total, com capacidade de atender a mais de 300 alunos e alunas no início de 2022, com  carga horária presencial de 4h30, em 200 dias letivos”. Antes do retorno parcial, as aulas estavam sendo ministradas remotamente, com o envio de material didático e atividades pelas redes sociais e mídias.

A volta total das atividades presenciais é aguardada, ansiosamente, pela dona de casa, Edna Lima de Andrade, 31 anos. Ela quer que o filho, Matheus Andrade de Souza, 2 anos, aproveite ao máximo as possibilidades do espaço. “Eu fiquei muito feliz por ter conseguido a matrícula para meu filho. Foi um momento em que me emocionei bastante. Agora, estou ansiosa pelo retorno total das atividades“, conta ela, ao destacar que o garoto está com mais energia e animado no convívio familiar após passar parte de seu tempo no Cemei.

Mais vagas, mais Cemeis

É para atender mães como Edna que a Prefeitura de Contagem está trabalhando para garantir vagas para crianças de zero a 3 anos nos Cemeis, uma vez que já contempla toda a demanda para os que têm 4 e 5 anos.

“Nosso desafio central é ampliar a oferta de educação infantil especialmente para o público  de zero a 3 anos.  Está no nosso planejamento a compra de terrenos para a construção de mais seis Cemeis. Além de um estudo para a construção de mais outras seis unidades”, adiantou a prefeita Marília Campos durante a visita.  “Estamos  conseguindo estruturar a educação infantil que é um direito das crianças e  também das mães, pois deixando os filhos aqui, elas têm como criar os outros filhos e  ainda trabalhar”, completou a chefe do Executivo.

Outro desafio, agora, apontado pela diretora do Cemei,  é se aproveitar de modo pedagógico da estrutura montada para “ colocar a criança no foco, como protagonista do projeto de ensino: cuidando dela e dando a ela todas as condições para se desenvolver de maneira completa e autônoma”.

 Segundo o vice-prefeito Ricardo Faria, a visita à unidade foi inspiradora. “De um lado vemos a forma de fazer gestão ao garantir uma escola pública de qualidade, uma escola inclusive, garantindo este direito para as crianças, para as mães, ao fornecer também o kit escolar, merenda escolar, computadores e esse suporte, em meio às dificuldades que as famílias estão vivendo por causa da pandemia, de oferecer a cesta básica. Na outra ponta a valorização dos professores, garantindo essa materialidade, o suporte tecnológico, com pacote de dados, que resulta no brilho no olhar do educador”, comentou ele ao afirmar a satisfação que sentiu ao perceber nos trabalhadores a alegria de compartilhar este momento.

Cestas Básicas, uma ajuda em meio a pandemia

Desde o dia 3 de dezembro, as famílias que têm filhos na Rede Municipal de Ensino, Rede Parceira e Fundação de Ensino de Contagem – Funec  estão recebendo da Prefeitura de Contagem cestas básicas para os estudantes. Cada família ganha o número de cestas de acordo com a quantidade de filhos matriculados na rede de ensino. O auxílio vem para as famílias contagenses em mais uma ação, desta vez resguardando a segurança alimentar e nutricional das famílias que vivenciaram mais um  ano marcado pelas dificuldades impostas pela  pandemia da Covid-19. Ao todo serão entregues 65 mil cestas básicas, com um investimento de R$87,29 por unidade, somando, aproximadamente, R$5,7 milhões.

Um ano novo de melhorias

Durante a visita, a prefeita Marília Campos ainda afirmou aos professores a valorização da classe a partir de 2022, quando o município ficará livre da Lei Federal 173 que proíbe o aumento dos gastos com pessoal dos entes federados. “Estamos programando para melhorar a situação dos servidores e educadores”.

Já no primeiro semestre, a secretária de Educação, Telma Fernanda Ribeiro, informou que os professores da rede municipal passarão por uma formação promovida em parceria com a Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais – UFMG, contemplando as áreas de educação infantil, integral e de jovens e adultos.

Mesmo diante de todos os desafios impostos pela pandemia, 2021 ficará marcado por melhorias nas condições de ensino para alunos e trabalhadores da rede municipal. Segundo a secretaria de Educação, foram locados computadores para 50% dos professores dos ensinos infantil e fundamental, sendo contemplados 100% dos professores da Educação de Jovens e Adultos – EJA. Cada escola receberá 20 notebooks para formar seus laboratórios de informática. Também foram adquiridos chips com pacotes de dados para todos os professores da rede, assim como  tablets. Estes serão distribuídos, no próximo ano, após a realização de um diagnóstico sobre a necessidade do equipamento para estudantes que tiveram ou ainda têm problemas com a internet. “Essas aquisições vêm como resultado de um diagnóstico que revelou os problemas existentes com a materialidade”, frisou Ribeiro.",[],179.0,0.0

Em reunião realizada no saguão da Prefeitura de Contagem, nesta quinta-feira (18/11), empreendedores da Feira do Eldorado estabeleceram junto à gestão municipal as diretrizes para realocação do empreendimento. Representantes de todos os segmentos da feira aproveitaram para apresentar as demandas de cada setor e reafirmaram a parceria com o poder público.

Estiveram presentes na reunião a prefeita Marília Campos; o vice-prefeito, Ricardo Faria; o presidente da Câmara Municipal, vereador Alex Chiodi; o secretário de Administração, Pedro Amaral; o presidente da Transcon, Renato Ribeiro; e o administrador da Regional Eldorado, Gil Martins. O encontro contou ainda com dez representantes de cada setor da feira.

Os feirantes tiveram a oportunidade de expressar suas dificuldades e trazer as demandas dos setores, como a distribuição e organização das barracas, a possibilidade de uso de mesas e cadeiras para os comerciantes de alimentos, cobertura da área, entre outros. Ficou determinado que um relatório será feito pontuando cada melhoria solicitada, a fim de avaliar o que é viável fazer, considerando a estrutura do novo local.

A feira, que estava sendo realizada na avenida João César de Oliveira, voltará a ser alocada na avenida José Faria da Rocha e nas ruas Inglaterra e Norberto Mayer. No mês de dezembro, haverá feiras extras no Natal e no Réveillon. As feiras ocorrerão  de 22 a 24 e dias 30 e 31, e servirão de teste para o novo local.

O administrador da Regional Eldorado, Gil Martins, saiu satisfeito da reunião e explicou quais são as próximas etapas. “Reunimos com a comissão paritária uma vez por mês e esta foi uma reunião ampliada por solicitação da Prefeitura, que queria conversar com todos os feirantes. O próximo passo agora é dar encaminhamento a essas deliberações feitas hoje. Vamos fazer o processo de medição da rua onde ficam as barracas e chamar todos os setores para definir onde cada um vai ficar”, esclareceu.

A prefeita Marília Campos explicou que não será possível realizar a feira na avenida João César de Oliveira por conta das obras do Sistema Integrado de Mobilidade – SIM que estão em andamento. Quando ela for concluída, a dinâmica do trânsito no local impedirá a permanência do grande fluxo de pessoas provocado pela feira. A chefe do Executivo pediu para que os feirantes se unam para construir junto ao Poder Público a melhor solução para que a feira siga fortalecida.

“É muito importante que os representantes de cada segmento ajude a encontrar a melhor solução. Da parte da Prefeitura, os feirantes terão o apoio necessário para debater, para construir de forma coletiva a forma ideal de fortalecer essa atividade econômica e cultural. Essa reunião mostra que estamos abertos ao diálogo, que aqui é um espaço de debate que deve ser utilizado. Se todos derem as mãos, encontraremos a solução”, declarou.

Sanar os gargalos enfrentados pelos comerciantes e impulsionar a feira é uma meta para a gestão, que tem priorizado encontrar soluções para os feirantes. “O que estamos fazendo em Contagem é ampliar as feiras, levando para todos os territórios, porque sabemos o que a pandemia causou nas famílias que dependem delas. Estamos estimulando a economia solidária e vamos fortalecer a feira também, mas precisamos de muito diálogo para alcançar a solução que beneficie a todos”, concluiu.

Atualmente, a Feira do Eldorado conta com 874 feirantes cadastrados, distribuídos na comercialização de vestuário adulto, infantil, alimentação, decoração, artesanato, couro e hortifruti.","['Eldorado', 'Feirantes do Eldorado', 'Feirantes', 'Contagem MG Marília', 'Campos Minas', 'Gerais PMC Prefeitura', 'Municipal', 'de', 'Contagem prefeita prefeita', 'Marília', 'Campos', 'Brasil']",157.0,0.0

A fim de diminuir os efeitos causados pela alta demanda por atendimento para casos de síndrome gripal nas Unidades de Pronto Atendimento-UPAs, Unidades Básicas de Saúde-UBSs e no Pronto Atendimento Pediátrico do Centro Materno Infantil de Contagem, percebido nas duas últimas semanas, a Prefeitura de Contagem vem buscando estratégias para diminuir o tempo de espera e a superlotação das unidades.

De acordo com prefeita Marília Campos, a administração vem seguindo diretrizes na busca pela comodidade e conforto para quem usa o serviço público para cuidar da saúde. “Temos enfrentado um surto de síndrome gripal e, com intuito de minimizar os efeitos, vamos ampliar o atendimento em seis Unidades Básicas de Saúde até às 20h e contratar profissionais para adequarmos o atendimento das UPAs a esse novo momento que estamos vivendo. Além disso, as escalas médicas das UPAs vêm sendo reforçadas com o objetivo de agilizar o atendimento dos pacientes”.

Tais medidas estão valendo a partir desta terça-feira (28/12) e, segundo o secretário de Saúde, Fabrício Simões, inicialmente, a ampliação do horário das UBSs será por uma semana, podendo ser estendida, caso seja necessário.

As ações foram anunciadas durante a visita da prefeita e do secretário, na manhã desta terça-feira, à UPA JK. Na oportunidade, eles conversaram com médicos, funcionários e pacientes para averiguar as necessidades recorrentes no local. A maior parte das pessoas relatou problemas com tempo de atendimento e grande fluxo de pessoas.

Em resposta, a prefeita Marília Campos lembrou que muitos usuários não vão às UBSs por causa do horário ou mesmo por acharem que estão com algo mais grave, salientou a importância da extensão do horário, bem como do fato das pessoas recorrerem primeiro às UBSs em caso de sintomas leves. “Aumentaremos o horário de atendimento nesta semana, pois as Unidades Básicas de Saúde são os locais que fazem esse primeiro atendimento. No caso de ser algo mais grave, as próprias unidades encaminham as pessoas para as UPAs, que darão o suporte. É importante esse fluxo até para evitar atraso em atendimentos e sobrecarga em determinados equipamentos”, ressaltou.

A chefe do Executivo lembrou que a Prefeitura está tomando as medidas necessárias para melhorar a assistência, mas pediu que a população colabore, buscando os locais adequados para atendimento de acordo com a situação, ressaltando que somente na UPA JK são mais de 10 mil atendimentos por mês, com pessoas não apenas de Contagem, mas de toda a Região Metropolitana.

Desafios e direcionamentos

O Centro de Informações Estratégicas em Vigilância em Saúde de Contagem-Cievs emitiu o segundo alerta de risco, no último dia 16 de dezembro, para as unidades, quanto ao aumento do registro de casos de síndrome gripal. Em Contagem, o aumento nos atendimentos por causa de síndromes gripais é de cerca de 30%.

Muito do atraso no atendimento se deve ao maior fluxo de pessoas que têm procurado as UPAs, principalmente, com problemas respiratórios leves. A Secretaria Municipal de Saúde orienta que a população procure estas unidades de urgência e emergência apenas para sintomas moderados ou graves. Para os casos leves, as pessoas devem procurar a Unidade Básica de Saúde – UBS mais próxima da residência.

De acordo com a médica Ângela Deise, atualmente, Contagem passa por um momento de aumento de casos de gripe, que possui sintomas parecidos com os da Covid-19. “Num primeiro momento, por causa de febre, dificuldade de alimentação, falta de ar, muita gente acredita que estar com Covid-19 e acabam procurando a UPA. Chegam, fazem o teste e não sendo constatado a contaminação pandêmica, damos um direcionamento adequado ao tratamento individualizado”, contou.

A superintendente das UPAs do Serviço Social Autônomo-SSA de Contagem, Beatriz Palhares, reforçou a necessidade do paciente buscar o atendimento no local próprio para cada situação. “Somente na UPA JK, nossa média de atendimentos diária é de 260 e passamos para mais de 400, nos últimos dias. Ontem (27/12), foram 485, sendo a maioria com síndrome gripal. Pedimos, assim, que, primeiramente, as pessoas procurem as UBSs, que possuem médicos, enfermeiros e técnicos, para esse primeiro atendimento e, se for um caso mais complexo, serão encaminhados para as UPAs ou seja remanejados pelo próprio equipamento básico. Assim vamos conseguir melhorar o processo, o atendimento e reduzir o tempo de espera”, explicou.

Cúpula dos Povos por Justiça Climática

A Mídia NINJA realizou uma cobertura especial da COP 26 em Glasgow.  Mobilizamos redes de ativismos em uma ação colaborativa envolvendo povos indígenas, mulheres, LGBT+s e jovens de periferia urbana de diferentes países. Trabalhamos para contar histórias com foco em Justiça social e climática, a partir de uma pluralidade de vozes do Sul Global, e cobramos de autoridades e governos ações imediatas e urgentes diante da crise ambiental e pela promoção de uma transição justa e rápida.

Em parceria com a #COP26Coalition, ocupamos as ruas e as redes. Organizamos uma cobertura colaborativa das marchas e da People's Summit fortalecendo as narrativas da luta por Justiça Climática.

90-mm M2A1 Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Tank Gun
SERIAL NUMBER 1559

In 1938 the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Board asked for a new anti-aircraft gun to replace their obsolete 3-inch guns. They selected the M1 90-mm anti-aircraft gun. The M1 went into service in 1940 on a platform with four foldable outriggers and a wheel carriage for towing. In 1941 the updated M1A1 went into service. The M1A1 could be controlled remotely from a director and had a higher rate of fire. The M1A1 became the Army's standard anti-aircraft gun during World War II.

Early in the war the United States military wanted a dual-purpose gun that could be used against aircraft, tanks, and boats. In May of 1943 the M2 went into service. The M2 could depress as low as -10 degrees allowing it hit ground and sea targets. Crew protection was added with a folding armor shield. Also added was the M20 fuse setter and rammer which increased the firing rate to 27 rounds per minute. M2s continued in service throughout the Korean War

Albert Bierstadt  (1830 - 1902)

Albert Bierstadt encountered many Plains tribes on his first journey west in 1859. This painting, completed later in his New York studio, is not a scene he witnessed firsthand, but rather one created from his imagination and informed by cultural attitudes of the mid-nineteenth century. This type of image of Plains Indians bathed in sunset was so widespread that it conveyed a misconception that American Indians were a vanishing race—an erroneous belief that continues today.

This World Class attraction was everything we expected and more.  Construction has just begun on a major expansion, but that has been managed in such a way that it does not in any way detract from the experience now.

This album focuses on the artwork inside the buildings and on the other interior spaces including the Eleven Restaurant and the Gift Shop.  A separate album posted a few days ago is devoted to the two April mornings that we spent exploring just some of the trails that crisscross the 120 acres of Arkansas forest around the museum.

Alice Walton and her co-creative team can be proud of the vision and execution of everything on this 120 acre site.

The Hunter Museum of American Art is an art museum in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The museum's collections include works representing the Hudson River School, 19th century genre painting, American Impressionism, the Ashcan School, early modernism, regionalism, and post-World War II modern and contemporary art.

The building itself represents three distinct architectural stages: the original 1904 classical revival mansion designed by Abram Garfield, the son of president James A. Garfield, which has housed the museum since its opening in 1952, a brutalist addition built in 1975, and a 2005 addition designed by Randall Stout which now serves as the entrance to the museum.

The museum is situated on an 80-foot (24 m) bluff overlooking the Tennessee River and downtown Chattanooga. The Faxon House, built in 1904, was built where a Confederate battery had been emplaced. Once a prestigious address for Victorian houses, the area is now home to the Bluff View Art District. The museum sits on a bluff that overlooks the Walnut Street Bridge. The Ruth S. and A. William Holmberg Pedestrian Bridge provides a pedestrian-friendly connection to the nearby Walnut Street Bridge and riverfront attractions.

The Hunter Museum is named after George Hunter, who inherited the Coca-Cola Bottling empire from his uncle Benjamin Thomas.  Thomas was one of the entrepreneurs who created Chattanooga's Coca-Cola bottling empire. Their nephew, George Hunter, later joined Anne Thomas to create a philanthropic organization in Hunter's memory named the Benwood Foundation. The foundation's mission was to &quot;promote religious, charitable, scientific, literary and educational activities for the advancement or well being of mankind&quot;. The centerpiece of the Benwood Foundation's gifts to the community of Chattanooga is the Hunter Museum of American Art, originally known as the Ross Faxon House.

In 2002 the Hunter Museum of American Art partnered with the City of Chattanooga, the Tennessee Aquarium and the Creative Discovery Museum to finish the 21st Century Waterfront Plan. The Hunter Museum portion of the project included a $22 million expansion and renovation, designed by Randall Stout that was completed in 2005. The project included 28,000 square feet of new construction, 34,000 square feet of renovation, a new entrance, a temporary exhibition space, restoration of the mansion, the creation of an outdoor sculpture and a complete reinstallation of the Museum's permanent collection.

The Hunter Museum of American Art includes 100 years of architectures and the most complete collection of American art in the Southeast. The museum also travels nationally for exhibits and curated shows. The collection spans from the colonial period to present day and covers a wide variety of media including painting, sculpture, contemporary studio glass, and crafts.

In 2006 the museum received national recognition from the Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steels awards program. The award recognizes outstanding achievements in engineering and architecture on structural steel projects around the country. The Hunter Museum project earned Merit Award recognition in the category of Projects $15–$75 million.

In June 2015, the Hunter Museum of Art announced on their official website that they had chosen a new executive director, Virginia Ann Sharber.

FRESHWATER AIRCRAFT CARRIERS
UNITED STATES 1943-1945
Built in the early 20th century, the Seeandbee and the Greater Buffalo were side-paddlewheel passenger steamliners used to ferry people and goods across the Great Lakes in the northern United States. During World War II the US Navy had a need for safe environment away from enemy submarines to train naval aviators in carrier operations. To meet this need both the Seeandbee and the Greater Buffalo were converted to the Freshwater Training Aircraft Carriers USS Wolverine and USS Sable for use on Lake Michigan. They had no hangar deck below the flight deck, aircraft elevators, or support facilities and were designated as miscellaneous-unclassified ships (IX). All aircraft were flown aboard each day from naval shore bases around the Great Lakes. By the end of the war both carriers trained close 18,000 pilots with an estimated 116,000 carrier landings.

USS WOLVERINE &amp; GENERAL MOTORS FM-2 WILDCAT
(BuNo 16161)
On April 12, 1945 just after 10:00AM, an FM-2 Wildcat (BuNo 16161) departed Glenview Naval Air Station, piloted by Ensign Robert L. Woodruff. He flew out over Lake Michigan to rendezvous with the training carrier USS Wolverine where he was to make the landings and takeoffs necessary to qualify to fly fighters from an aircraft carrier. Thirty minutes later at 10:40 AM, Ensign Woodruff made a landing approach to the Wolverine. Just before he reached the deck, the Landing Signal Officer noted he was too low and waved him off. Unfortunately, the plane touched down on the deck just as Woodruff applied power to go around. The tail hook caught one of the arresting wires and the plane was dragged down to the deck and over the port side of the ship into the water. Ensign Woodruff was not hurt and was returned to Glenview for more practice. The Wildcat sank into the lake and lay on the bottom for over 50 years. In the mid-1990s, the US Navy recovered several aircraft lost in training accidents from Lake Michigan. This particular plane was traded to the Military Aircraft Restoration Corporation and is now on display here at the Pima Air and Space Museum.","['USS Wolverine', 'IX-64', 'FM-2', 'Wildcat', 'F4F', 'F4F Wildcat', 'FM-2 Wildcat', 'BuNo 16161', '16161']",221.0,0.0

The Gloster Meteor was developed during World War II and was the only jet fighter to see operational service with the Allied Forces during the war. Development of the Meteor began in 1940 with the first flights in 1943. By the middle of 1944 a small number of Meteors were operational with the RAF’s Number 6 Squadron. They were used to intercept the German V-1 flying bombs and at least 14 Buzz Bombs were shot down by Meteors. Development of the Meteor continued after World War II and later versions of the aircraft served with the RAF until 1962.

The two seat Meteor T.7 trainer was introduced in 1948.  Over 700 were built for the RAF, Royal Navy and seven foreign customers. Several two seat Meteors have been modified to serve as aerial test platforms for ejection seat testing. A modified canopy allows the rear seat to be ejected in flight to test new seat designs. At least two of these aircraft are still in use by the Martin Baker company in 2019.

The F-5 was developed in conjunction with the T-38 Talon trainer as a private venture of the Northrop company. The U.S. Government selected it in 1962 for production as an export fighter for countries participating in the Military Assistance Program.  In 1970 the U.S. Air Force issued a request for proposals for a replacement for the F-5A and B. The competition was won by Northrop with an upgraded version of the F-5. The new version featured upgraded avionics, more powerful engines, a longer fuselage and larger wings all of which gave the plane a significantly improved performance. The single seat version was designated F-5E and the two-seat version was the F-5F. They also received the new name Tiger II. The F-5E and F were widely exported and several countries continue to use them. The U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines have all used the F-5E and F-5F as Aggressor aircraft teaching military pilots the fundamentals of air-to-air combat.

The old Peabody College campus now houses Vanderbilt’s Peabody College of Education and Human Development.

Für Sonntag 19. Juni 2022 rief die Gruppe „Rote Linie Saarbrücken“ erneut zu einer Demonstration gegen Coronamaßnahmen in Saarbrücken auf. Nur noch rund 250 Teilnehmende fanden sich dafür trotz bestem Wetter auf dem Landwehrplatz ein. Zu Spitzenzeiten konnten hier über 5.000 Menschen mobilisiert werden. An der sinkenden Zahl konnte weder die geladene Szeneprominenz, noch die aus Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg und Luxemburg angereiste Unterstützung etwas ändern.

Die Auftaktkundgebung startete mit einem Bühnenprogramm von Björn Winter, alias „Björn Banane“, und dem Thüringer „Busfahrer Thomas“ Brauner, die mit Playback-Songs versuchten die nicht vorhandene Masse der als „Großdemonstration“ angekündigten Veranstaltung anzuheizen. Von der Bühne wurden diverse verschwörungsideologische Narrative verbreitet. Redner Wolfgang Greulich drohte Journalist*innen mit Klage, sollte ihm die Berichterstattung über seine Rede nicht zusagen. Im Anschluss an die Kundgebung zog der Demonstrationszug durch die Saarbrücker Innenstadt. Angeführt wurde der Marsch von den „Trommlern aus Pforzheim“, die auf ihrer Tour nach Berlin zuvor bereits zu Demonstrationen in anderen Städten angetreten sind. Abgeschlossen wurde die Versammlung auf dem Landwehrplatz mit Musikbeiträgen des Sulzbacher Liedermachers und Maßnahmengegners Guy Dawson.

Etwa ein halbes Dutzend Personen versammelte sich zu einem Gegenprotest auf dem Gustav-Regler-Platz. Aufgerufen dazu hatte die Partei „DIE PARTEI“ unter dem Motto „Mahnwache gegen absurde Demonstrationen verwirrter Spaziergänger:innen mit zuviel Tagesfreizeit“.","['Versammlung', 'Demonstration', 'Saarland', 'Saarbrücken', 'Coronaleugner', 'Verschwörungsideologie', 'Rote Linie', 'Impfgegner', 'Streamer', 'Tattoo']",170.0,0.0

The Oklahoma Fallen and Living Firefighters Memorial, Just Another Day, honors all Oklahoma firefighters who have served our citizens since the inception of the Oklahoma State Firefighters Association in 1894. It was sculpted by artist Shahla Rahimi Reynolds of Oklahoma City.

Recognizing Oklahoma Firefighters
Firefighter names are inscribed in granite and those firefighters who gave the supreme sacrifice have the special and most honored space reserved at the park - The Wall of Valor. The Memorial is unique in that all Oklahoma firefighters who have served their communities for more than 20 years on an OSFA-member department or retired through disability are recognized.","['Oklahoma', 'Oklahoma City', 'firefighting', 'firefighter', 'fire memorial', 'OSFA']",77.0,0.0

Sunrise was shortly after 5 a.m. so I got an early start and got to the field around 5:15 - and people were there already! The bad thing was the sun rose almost directly behind the landing aircraft. We went en masse to Hatton Cross Underground Station and found some better angles. After a bit the sun got higher and was less harsh so we went back to the field. Beautiful day just sitting there watching life go by - until I fell asleep in my chair. I decided to return to my room for a proper nap. I regret that now since a bunch of cool planes landed and I would rather have shot them outdoors. Hopefully there will be a next time soon.

DEATH OF SIR HOWARD ELLIS M.B.E.
PROMINENT SUVA RESIDENT
WELL-KNOWN IN CAMBRIDGE
Sir Howard Ellis, M.B.E., of Suva, Fiji, died at the Mater Hospital, Auckland, on Wednesday. He had not been in good health for some time.
Sir Howard was born at Waipu, North Auckland, in 1889, being a son of the late Mr Howard J. S. Ellis, headmaster of the Waipu School and at one time prior to that on the staff of the Cambridge School. He was educated at the Auckland Grammar School and graduated B.A. and L.L.B., from Auckland University College.
He was called to the Fiji Bar in 1912; but left to serve in the 1914-18 War, first in the Northumberland Fusiliers and later in one of the earliest squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps. Shot down over France in 1916, he was a prisoner of war until exchanged in 1918, when he re-enlisted to serve again with the Royal Air Force in the defence of London. At this time he was awarded the M.B.E.
Sir Howard was married in London to Mary, younger daughter of Sir Thomas Mackenzie, then New Zealand High Commissioner; she died in 1924. Returning to Suva, he recommenced his practice and took an active part in the life of the Colony, as a member of the Executive Council, as a director of several companies, and as Legal Adviser to the Diocese of Polynesia. He was a keen player of cricket, tennis and squash racquets, and he also took a great interest in all other sport. In 1926, he married Nell, a daughter of Mr Alexander Joske, of Suva.
During World War II, he served on the War Council of the Governor of Fiji, Sir Phillip Mitchell, and in 1942 he undertook the arduous work of Director of Manpower and Controller of National Service. For this he was Knighted in 1942.
In recent years, he spent much of his time at Cambridge. He is survived by Lady Ellis, a son and daughter, Mr John Ellis and Miss Susan Ellis, both of whom are attending the Auckland University College.
